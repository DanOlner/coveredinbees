Words have been getting a bit of a kicking lately. As a few poeple have noted, humans just lost their monopoly on being able to produce coherent written language...

Is that a good way to start this? Christ, the first paragraph. Never start there. Do the first paragraph *last*. Obviously. Why is that so hard to remember? Anyway, let's try that again and explain what I'm trying to do here.

Err. Writing is an interative process. You have to allow yourself the [shitty first drafts](https://wrd.as.uky.edu/sites/default/files/1-Shitty%20First%20Drafts.pdf). For mere humans, SFDs are not optional - plural, for there can be many, many of them before writing approaches anything like coherent, before it can appear like you actually thought up a structured argument in the first place, before you even *know* what you might be trying to say.

And then something about how we can lean into the SFD, make that process open, and all the reasons that's a good thing. Or could be a good thing.
