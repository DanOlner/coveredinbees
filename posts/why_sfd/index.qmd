**Welcome to coveredinbees, a site where I waffle, mull, connect and maybe over time try to hone thoughts into something more digestible.** 

You've got the option of subscribing to [first drafts](https://danolner.github.io/coveredinbees/index.xml) here, as well as [final drafts](https://danolner.github.io/coveredinbees/index-final.xml) (RSS links). 

**The email subscription option defaults to final pieces only - tick the '1st draft' box you want in on the 1st drafts.** 

**Why on Earth would I be giving you the option to read 1st drafts? Isn't life short enough already?** Brief answer followed by longer ramble.

* I'm using "1st draft" here to mean: the start of an idea or topic, in a post that I'll continue to edit, ramble in, add links and connected thoughts, keeping it all in one place and regularly [pushing to github](https://github.com/DanOlner/coveredinbees).
	- In "1st drafts" I'll try and lay out what I think the questions are and get some first points down. These may just be snippets that never go anywhere or they may grow. Though it absolutely will include [shitty first drafts](https://wrd.as.uky.edu/sites/default/files/1-Shitty%20First%20Drafts.pdf) along the way, the point is to get stuff out there, experiment with it and let it grow.
* This is also part of having **more control and ownership**. Everything here is on my own machine as well as [stored on Github](https://github.com/DanOlner/coveredinbees) (admittedly, owned by Microsoft). If anyone so desires - why would you, that'd be mad, but if you *wanted* to- you could look at the history of any file ([here's](https://github.com/DanOlner/coveredinbees/commits/master/posts/why_sfd/index.qmd) this one's) and see what's changed (e.g. a [recent commit difference](https://github.com/DanOlner/coveredinbees/commit/78788d0ca8ecbc5e46305a3849a196bf17e16165#diff-b4ac3c529b00f3e9f57376c3dd67f1700d6c2c70e2f62874c67ae7307faf0dae)).








* I want to build in the idea that all writing/thinking starts out a mess. You have to allow yourself the [shitty first drafts](https://wrd.as.uky.edu/sites/default/files/1-Shitty%20First%20Drafts.pdf). Arguably no-one wants to see that mess - why not skip to the end?

OK, the longer version. 

Words have been getting a bit of a kicking lately. Looming in everyone's vision right now is (as a few people have put it e.g. [here](https://www.spglobal.com/en/research-insights/special-reports/language-modeling-the-fundamentals), [here](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11137430/), [here](https://bigwildmindmachine.substack.com/p/the-ny-times-vs-openai)) that humans just lost their monopoly on written language to robots that digested everything ever written, [Johnny-5 style](https://youtu.be/WnTKllDbu5o?t=42) (OK, not like that).

But while everyone argues about just how radical the LLM shift is, the machinery of language has been shifting around us for a good while longer. Who knows where it might land after all this. It's obvious to state but words are/were the sinews of scientific progress, a still-surviving modernist structure built up layer by layer through argument and counter-argument[^1], a somehow-functioning mix of reason and chance. Human knowledge *grew*.

It's still growing, but [informatics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Informatics_(disambiguation)) is upending a lot of the ways it can grow, and it's opened us up to the language equivalents of distributed [denial of service attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack). 



It's unavoidably political, of course. 
Authoritarian truth
has a lot of weird Venn diagram overlap with its apparent opposite, libertarian truth (another case where political compasses point in directions that eventually meet on the other side of the planet)
The absolutist position best seen in Peter Thiel / person who said DISC

Same with Musk's take on 'emergent intelligence', and makes exactly the same wilful error that Hayekian thinking does - if you tear apart existing structures, some kind of fairy dust will emerge



[^1]: A Bauman point, that one: modernism - "a ‘total’ order to be erected floor by floor in a protracted, consistent, purpose-guided effort of labour.” (Liquid modernity)
