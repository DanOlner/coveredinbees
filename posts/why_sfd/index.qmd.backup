You've got the option of subscribing to [first drafts](https://danolner.github.io/coveredinbees/index.xml) here, as well as [final drafts](https://danolner.github.io/coveredinbees/index-final.xml) (either with those RSS links, or email subscription via Buttondown). Why? Short version, followed by longer ramble.

* I want to build in the idea that all writing/thinking starts out a mess. You have to allow yourself the [shitty first drafts](https://wrd.as.uky.edu/sites/default/files/1-Shitty%20First%20Drafts.pdf). Arguably no-one wants to see that mess - why not skip to the end?
* That's always possible, but being open - and doing that using open platforms like github - lets in some chances for experimentation. More on that below.

OK, the longer version. 

Words have been getting a bit of a kicking lately. Looming in everyone's vision right now is (as a few people have put it e.g. [here](https://www.spglobal.com/en/research-insights/special-reports/language-modeling-the-fundamentals), [here](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11137430/), [here](https://bigwildmindmachine.substack.com/p/the-ny-times-vs-openai)) that humans just lost their monopoly on written language to machines that digested everything ever written, Johnny-5 style (OK, not liket)

But while everyone argues about just how radical the LLM shift is, the machinery of language has been shifting around us for a good while longer. Who knows where it might land after all this. It's obvious to state but words are/were the sinews of scientific progress, a still-surviving modernist structure built up layer by layer through argument and counter-argument[^1], a somehow-functioning mix of reason and chance. Human knowledge *grew*.

It's still growing, but [informatics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Informatics_(disambiguation)) is upending a lot of the ways it can grow, and it's opened us up to the language equivalents of distributed [denial of service attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack). 



[^1]: A Bauman point, that one: modernism - "a ‘total’ order to be erected floor by floor in a protracted, consistent, purpose-guided effort of labour.” (Liquid modernity) 


## CUTTINZ

Words have been getting a bit of a kicking lately. As a few people have noted, humans just lost their monopoly on being able to produce coherent written language...

Is that a good way to start this? Christ, the first paragraph. Never start there. Do the first paragraph *last*. Obviously. Why is that so hard to remember? Anyway, let's try that again and explain what I'm trying to do here.

Err. Writing is an interative process. You have to allow yourself the [shitty first drafts](https://wrd.as.uky.edu/sites/default/files/1-Shitty%20First%20Drafts.pdf). For mere humans, SFDs are not optional - plural, for there can be many, many of them before writing approaches anything like coherent, before it can appear like you actually thought up a structured argument in the first place, before you even *know* what you might be trying to say.

And then something about how we can lean into the SFD, make that process open, and all the reasons that's a good thing. Or could be a good thing.
