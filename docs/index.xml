  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>New: and this would be the final draft, going to people who don’t want to see the wiring.</p>
<p>Old: This would be the initial draft doc including all the planning.</p>
<p>Draft materials are <a href="../FromDraftToFinal_DRAFT">here</a> (way to automate would be nice! Have a mull about that.)</p>

  <title>21st Century peer review</title>
  <dc:creator>Dan Olner</dc:creator>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>21st century peer review, how to make it work. Separate out all the different types e.g.&nbsp;tiny incremental technical progress in papers (some patenting to get IP) is a very different world to e.g.&nbsp;open urban work. Structures vastly different. Or exploratory thought pieces vs medical testing. Put in context of what we do not want to happen: what happened with supposed ‘citizen science’ for climate change, which was just idiots shouting “I am Galileo!” Some but not all of those oil-funded, some but not all of those with raging Dunning-Kruger. (Cf. <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~fukamit/schwartz-2008.pdf">constructive stupidity</a>.)</p>
<p>Other random points:</p>
<ul>
<li>Now equivalent of DDOS attack via LLMs…?</li>
<li>New tools? Github as way to produce, review, edit in a fully open and traceable way?</li>
<li>The ostensible goal: continue to increase real knowledge a slice at a time. But what role does or could knowledge systems play in this? Back to the original “how does science / how does knowledge growth <em>actually</em> work vs how we imagine it should”. Overlaps with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demarcation_problem">demarcation problem</a> / shows up in arguments around <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientism">scientism</a>. (That’s a really great wikipedia article on the subject).</li>
</ul>

  <title>What an SFD looks like. Why do it here?</title>
  <dc:creator>Dan Olner</dc:creator>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>You’ve got the option of subscribing to <a href="https://danolner.github.io/coveredinbees/index.xml">first drafts</a> here, as well as <a href="https://danolner.github.io/coveredinbees/index-final.xml">final drafts</a> (either with those RSS links, or email subscription via Buttondown). Why? Short version, followed by longer ramble.</p>
<p>For my own benefit, to keep a record, to allow for free exploration, excessive verbosity, then move toward a point eventually.</p>
<ul>
<li>I want to build in the idea that all writing/thinking starts out a mess. You have to allow yourself the <a href="https://wrd.as.uky.edu/sites/default/files/1-Shitty%20First%20Drafts.pdf">shitty first drafts</a>. Arguably no-one wants to see that mess - why not skip to the end?</li>
<li>That’s always possible, but being open - and doing that using open platforms like github - lets in some chances for experimentation. More on that below.</li>
</ul>
<p>OK, the longer version.</p>
<p>Words have been getting a bit of a kicking lately. Looming in everyone’s vision right now is (as a few people have put it e.g.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.spglobal.com/en/research-insights/special-reports/language-modeling-the-fundamentals">here</a>, <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11137430/">here</a>, <a href="https://bigwildmindmachine.substack.com/p/the-ny-times-vs-openai">here</a>) that humans just lost their monopoly on written language to robots that digested everything ever written, <a href="https://youtu.be/WnTKllDbu5o?t=42">Johnny-5 style</a> (OK, not like that).</p>
<p>But while everyone argues about just how radical the LLM shift is, the machinery of language has been shifting around us for a good while longer. Who knows where it might land after all this. It’s obvious to state but words are/were the sinews of scientific progress, a still-surviving modernist structure built up layer by layer through argument and counter-argument<sup>1</sup>, a somehow-functioning mix of reason and chance. Human knowledge <em>grew</em>.</p>
<p>It’s still growing, but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Informatics_(disambiguation)">informatics</a> is upending a lot of the ways it can grow, and it’s opened us up to the language equivalents of distributed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack">denial of service attacks</a>.</p>
<p>It’s unavoidably political, of course. Authoritarian truth has a lot of weird Venn diagram overlap with its apparent opposite, libertarian truth (another case where political compasses point in directions that eventually meet on the other side of the planet) The absolutist position best seen in Peter Thiel / person who said DISC</p>
<p>Same with Musk’s take on ‘emergent intelligence’, and makes exactly the same wilful error that Hayekian thinking does - if you tear apart existing structures, some kind of fairy dust will emerge</p>
<section id="cuttinz" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="cuttinz">CUTTINZ</h2>
<p>Words have been getting a bit of a kicking lately. As a few people have noted, humans just lost their monopoly on being able to produce coherent written language…</p>
<p>Is that a good way to start this? Christ, the first paragraph. Never start there. Do the first paragraph <em>last</em>. Obviously. Why is that so hard to remember? Anyway, let’s try that again and explain what I’m trying to do here.</p>
<p>Err. Writing is an interative process. You have to allow yourself the <a href="https://wrd.as.uky.edu/sites/default/files/1-Shitty%20First%20Drafts.pdf">shitty first drafts</a>. For mere humans, SFDs are not optional - plural, for there can be many, many of them before writing approaches anything like coherent, before it can appear like you actually thought up a structured argument in the first place, before you even <em>know</em> what you might be trying to say.</p>
<p>And then something about how we can lean into the SFD, make that process open, and all the reasons that’s a good thing. Or could be a good thing.</p>
