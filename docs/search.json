Only a shrinking fraction of which is now human-produced, you say? The noise an unbearable tinnitus that makes you want to set your own head in concrete, you say?\nWhat you need, I think, is another blog. And look over there! A subscribe button! Go on. If you’re really keen, too keen, click the ‘send me 1st drafts’ button as well (see here for why this option’s available).\nRSS feeds top right, some links to other places above and below.\n\np.s. that pic is a killer onion I made for the Sharrow Lantern Carnival in 2006.

    "text": "Welcome to coveredinbees, a site where I waffle, mull, connect and maybe over time try to hone thoughts into something more digestible.\nYou’ve got the option of subscribing to first drafts here, as well as final drafts (RSS links).\nThe email subscription option defaults to final pieces only - tick the ‘1st draft’ box you want in on the 1st drafts.\nWhy on Earth would I be giving you the option to read 1st drafts? Isn’t life short enough already? Brief answer followed by longer ramble.\nOK, the longer version.\nWords have been getting a bit of a kicking lately. Looming in everyone’s vision right now is (as a few people have put it e.g. here, here, here) that humans just lost their monopoly on written language to robots that digested everything ever written, Johnny-5 style (OK, not like that).\nBut while everyone argues about just how radical the LLM shift is, the machinery of language has been moving around us for a good while longer as informatics has worked its way into every cell over the last few decades.\nIt’s obvious to state, but words are the sinews of social and scientific progress. Science is a still-surviving modernist structure built up layer by layer through argument and counter-argument1, a somehow-functioning mix of reason and chance. Informatics is upending a lot of the ways it can grow, and it’s opened us up to language equivalents of distributed denial of service attacks - nothing more sophisticated, really, than a bunch of people constantly shouting nonsense while others are in the room trying to think. But it’s been effective nonetheless (climate example in Nature), and LLMs may be pouring petrol on that (see e.g. openAI here, here, also here).\nIt’s unavoidably political, of course. Authoritarian truth has a lot of weird Venn diagram overlap with its apparent opposite, libertarian truth (another case where political compasses point in directions that eventually meet on the other side of the planet) The absolutist position best seen in Peter Thiel / person who said DISC\nSame with Musk’s take on ‘emergent intelligence’, and makes exactly the same wilful error that Hayekian thinking does - if you tear apart existing structures, some kind of fairy dust will emerge"

Separate out all the different types e.g. tiny incremental technical progress in papers (some patenting to get IP) is a very different world to e.g. open urban work. Structures vastly different. Or exploratory thought pieces vs medical testing. Put in context of what we do not want to happen: what happened with supposed ‘citizen science’ for climate change, which was just idiots shouting “I am Galileo!” Some but not all of those oil-funded, some but not all of those with raging Dunning-Kruger. (Cf. constructive stupidity.)\nOther random points:\n\nNow equivalent of DDOS attack via LLMs…?\nNew tools? Github as way to produce, review, edit in a fully open and traceable way?\nThe ostensible goal: continue to increase real knowledge a slice at a time. But what role does or could knowledge systems play in this? Back to the original “how does science / how does knowledge growth actually work vs how we imagine it should”. Overlaps with the demarcation problem / shows up in arguments around scientism. (That’s a really great wikipedia article on the subject)."
