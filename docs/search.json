Here’s what ‘economic / spatial / political’ covers, roughly: “Where everything human comes together and crashes into everything else. All our loves, hopes, poverty, riches, work, community, loneliness, travel, arguments, divisions, pot hole incidents. We live in the middle of this mess, and it works bafflingly well, though it’s riddled with dysfunction. Do we know why it works? When things break, do we know why it stopped working? Do we know enough to make plans, to have ambitions and dreams, to change things, to know when to leave alone? Who gets to decide what changes?”\nMixed in with bonus random topics (my other writing is a good guide), there’ll be posts asking, “Are we more than just mindless ants? What systems can we build to maximise our chances of being more than that?” (Two examples of older posts about this: how humans are natural distributed systems makers, what Balinese rice pest management, Peruvian potato growing and the market economy have in common, why it’s all tangled up with magic and why it means Hayek was wrong; picking apart Jordan Peterson’s tediously shallow neoliberalism that underpins his climate nonsense, as a reminder that we are not, in fact, just mindless ants).\nI wrote a sci-fi book about AI, which I finished in the summer of 2022 after four years of research/writing… a couple of months before the 1st chatGPT public release. I’m going to do one more re-draft before self-publishing (after failed attempts to foist it on real publishers2). I’ll write about this process, as well as the book’s ideas and themes in an “LLM before / after” light. What still works, what doesn’t? Is there any point when every other social media post and news story is now about AI? It’s a terrible idea to retrofit too heavily based on new info, but a few tweaks might be fun."

    "text": "About me / this site\nI called my first ever blog ‘coveredinbees’ back in 2006 before embarking on a PhD. The name was an Izzard-flavoured hat-tip to the emergence / self-organisation ideas I planned to study. (Someone later pointed out I could also have linked to the Fable of the Bees, didn’t think of that at the time.)\nEarly posts (a few surviving on the wayback machine) like this were largely unstructured rambles of faintly connected thoughts. Various incarnations survived over the years; this archive was the last one and this page lists my favourite bits.\nTwenty years later, of course, through diligent practice and academic training, my writing is now like a scalpel.\nHahahaha. I jest. No. I did manage to write a PhD (in twice the time I was supposed to) and that sci-fi book I mentioned. But from those early puppyish, over-enthusiastic ramblings of youth, I have passed through trying to be something I’m not, back in my autumn years3 to “Aaaaa just get on with the rambling. Who cares? We’ll all be dead soon.”\nSlightly less flippantly… coveredinbees (and early C21st blogging generally, a world that still survives at the margins) allowed a kind of free exploration and experimentation that I miss. That dovetails with the direction work is taking, as I’m playing with opening up economic tools and ideas.\nSetting this up to work through Quarto and github is considerably more faff than, say, signing up for Substack. But this gives me more control and ownership as well as leaving an accountability trail - everything here is on my own machine as well as stored on github (admittedly, owned by Microsoft). If anyone so desires - why would you, that’d be mad, but if you wanted to - you could look at the history of any file (here’s this one’s) and see what’s changed (e.g. a recent commit difference). You could even sign up to github and add comments.\nIn our bold new LLM world, this is also one way to show it’s this particular dumb, stumbling meatsack erratically flapping at the keys.\nAnd why make things simple when they can be complicated? The Douglas Adams principle of programming:\n\n“I am rarely happier than when spending an entire day programming my computer to perform automatically a task that would otherwise take me a good ten seconds to do by hand.”"

As a few people have put it (e.g. here, here, here) humans just lost their monopoly on written language to robots that digested everything ever written, Johnny-5 style (OK, not like that).\nBut the machinery of language has been radically rewiring for decades, as informatics have worked their way into every cell1.\nWords are the sinews of social and scientific progress. Informatics has already upended older ways these sinews stay supple and strengthen. It’s also opened us up to human-comms equivalents of distributed denial of service attacks - really nothing more sophisticated than a bunch of people constantly shouting nonsense while others in the room try to think. But it’s been dismayingly effective (climate example in Nature), and LLMs may be pouring petrol on that (see e.g. openAI here, here, also here).\nScience (and all knowledge flavours that accrete around universities and other research sites) is a still-surviving modernist structure built up layer by layer through argument and counter-argument2, a somehow-functioning mix of reason and chance. Science is struggling. It’s trying to adapt to new tech, or through inertia failing to. It’s shaken by Language DDOS (climate science under attack; ‘sick of experts’; in the U.S., direct authoritarian attacks)."

    "text": "BITS\nThis is all deeply political, of course. Authoritarians want to be the sole source of truth, and twist words accordingly. The internet age suits them just fine. But there’s a lot of weird Venn diagram overlap with its apparent opposite, libertarian truthiness3. See Peter Thiel talking about Eric Weinstein’s term, the ‘Distributed Idea Suppression Complex’. As Thiel puts it, ’The internet has already begun our liberation from the DISC prison… the media organisations, bureaucracies, universities and government-funded NGOs that traditionally delimited public conversation”.\nGramscian cultural hegemony comparisons abound, so that’s nothing new - and I’m not disagreeing that institutions use words to shape reality. What’s striking is DISC’s banality. You can see the same in Musk’s take on Twitter/X:\n\n“Because it consists of billions of bidirectional interactions per day, Twitter can be thought of as a collective, cybernetic, super-intelligence.”\n\nIt’s that sufficient-condition “because of” that gets me. Nope, it’s not intelligent because of those interactions. My cup of tea consists of trillions of bidirectional interactions. It has no smarts. This is exactly the same wilful error that Hayekian thinking is often guilty of (more-so than Hayek himself I think) - if you tear things down, a magic fairy dust will ‘emerge’ to replace it. And if you get in the way of that happening, you’re part of the DISC / woke mind virus.\nIntriguing that the outcome ends up following the grain of authoritarianism - that can be seen in the targets that both attack. Both have implicit theories of truth that seem so opposite: one sole, all-controlling source versus an emergent, everywhere-truth that no-one controls. But the effect on the machinery of knowledge generation is more or less identical. Compare to the famous Arendt quote from Truth and Politics:\n\n“The result of a consistent and total substitution of lies for factual truth is not that the lie will now be accepted as truth and truth be defamed as lies, but that the sense by which we take our bearings in the real world - and the category of truth versus falsehood is among the mental means to this end - is being destroyed.”\n\nThat italiced chunk applies equally to both flavours of the right I’m talking about.\nLet’s not push the parallel too far. Libertarians aren’t into disappearing people off the street for what they say. But that’s why the childishness of DISC thinking is so frustrating - it seems content to enable its opposite.\nSo that’s the world that LLMs have entered, that we find ourselves in now. The (actually very useful) idea of emergence is weaponised, paving the way for authoritarians to tediously re-prove Arendt over and over, with added trollfarms. To the extent that DISC thinking has a point - knowledge structures are dominated by white males on computers like me, by wealthy global institutions, of which universities are certainly members - they let the actual point go sailing past: addressing this means exactly the kind of ‘how do we get more voices in here?’ thinking most of them seem to loath."

    "text": "Douglas Adams said:\nThis is exactly the kind of productivity thinking the country needs, I think. I’ve been trying to follow his example recently. I am trying to disassemble how I do things / why I’m doing them / whether I should I just sit in my pants all day eating pringles / what sort of task-environment-brain re-jigs might help answer any of those questions. This is leading to many “all day programming for a ten second task” moments.\nIt’s all part of joining in the currently very fashionable and exciting pastime of “wondering what kind of brain I have and whether it really needs to have been so bloody difficult all this time.” (Analogy: as a left-hander, if I’d always been made to use my right hand, as was the case pre 1950ish.) Coming at it like a design problem, prototyping things that may end up on the scrapheap, is the only way.\nSo rather than get on with, say, actually working on the sci-fi book or writing about anything concrete, I’ve done the following:\nSo now the process of writing a blog post couldn’t be simpler. I just (1) write it in Obsidian as I’m doing now; (2) use the Obsidian-to-Quarto export function; (3) in RStudio, run the R function to convert exobrain links and YAML and move the files; (4) when in a state I’m happy to publish, move it manually to the posts folder (that could be streamlined); (5) run ‘render’ on that final post in RStudio so the HTML goes to the docs folder; (6) git stage/commit and push in Gitraken to get it live on coveredinbees. Done! Just like that. Substack schmubschmack.\nSigh. I am reminded a little of the Mars Curiosity Rover’s landing plan (in one of my all time favourite youtube videos, recorded before they knew whether it would succeed). Aim for a flat spot, use Mars’ atmosphere to slow down a little (it’s 1% the density of Earth’s), use a huge parachute, release a cap to view the ground, drop the rover carried by its own rocket stage because none of that can slow it down enough, but you can’t use rockets to land because the dust will bugger the rover’s systems - so hover above the ground and lower it on four wires, and then boost the rocket stage off to the side so it doesn’t crash on top of the now-on-Mars Curiosity. Oh and do all that entirely automatically because signals to Mars were a 14 minute round trip at the time. Done! Just like that. Elon Schmelon.\nHere’s Jazz-student turned NASA entry/descent/landing lead Adam Steltzner:\nReasoned engineering thought, though, takes a lot of testing. The problem with testing human brains, or at least mine, is the tendency to default to “you’re just a useless idiot” and stop at that, rather than taking little steps, inching forward, playing, trying new things, seeing what goes with the grain, what rubs against it. It needs resetting daily as the self-blame module can be deeply wired in - previous perceived failures obviously a personal failure, says the module, rather than allowing consideration of the whole you/task/environment setup1.\nSo while I’m obviously getting those sweet sweet Douglas Adams Dopamine Hits from all this ridiculous tinkering, it’s… not entirely ridiculous. None of this is novel - here’s a nice writeup of the general digital garden idea, it’s in that ballpark. The world is littered with failed ‘Systems That Will Solve Everything’, but maybe there’s merit in this kind of slow, tentative gardening.\nAll the ‘digital garden’ tech is allowing is easy linkage - it’s been described as ‘your own personal wikipedia’. But replicating existing links would seem pointless, no? So the test here is: can it be used to add little modular chunks, questions, connections? In a way that isn’t just building an ideas oubliette? What, if anything, can it really add?\nI’m finding that when you start playing with the task/environment/self parts, they all start affecting each other in unexpected ways. One of the most intriguing: what it’s doing to what I think words are actually for. That’s led to a List of writing questions (see, nice exobrain link; sorry, some LLM assistance in that list). There’s a long section on different functions of writing where “narrow professional words” are in the minority. There’s also writing for one’s own brain/ psychology/emotions; connection; experimentation; identity building…\nThat rather solipsistic view segues into bigger veins and arteries we all share. I tried “Writing” about that - it’s got some of the ideas there, but… too much. Let’s see if it’s possible to pick away at it more slowly. It feels like a very specific historical moment for language, when humans have lost their monopoly on the written word (people pointing that out here, here, here), when the collective lighthouses we used to steer away from the Deathly Rocks of Bullshit are under well-funded, sustained attack.\nThat’s enough to make it feel like finding your own words is pointless. Working theory: it isn’t, it’s more important than ever. So let’s add that one to the list for later:"

    "text": "BITS\n\nWe already have incredible data. The issue is finding ways to make it talk. (That’s not to say we don’t need more and better data, see below…)\n\nExample: regional sector output from the ONS. I’ve used a bunch of different data sources in my time with SYMCA so far, but this is the one I’ve returned to the most. (Their original data; my nice machine-readable / combined-with-job-data version.) It’s the entire UK spatial economy squeezed into a tiny set of numbers. It allows you to see granular economic history going back to 1998, see huge structural shifts. You can see where we’ve come from - absolutely essential for figuring out where we’re heading.\nIt’s not the kind of dataset that makes people swoon, the opposite of Big Data (do we still talk about that any more?), nothing to do with AI. It’s just a high-concentrate distillation of economic goodness in a tiny package. I keep on finding new things in there it can show us all the time (and sometimes things in there that suggest it’s a little bit eccentric).\n(Yes, regional GVA numbers need slathering in caveats — I’ll do that another time, though the ONS explain how the sausage is made here and how much is “observed vs estimated vs modelled” here. And I’m just reading Diane Coyle’s latest book where she is very affectionately working up to suggesting national accounts need euthenising…)\nAll that awesomeness is hidden in an excel document. ONS have their own analysis (latest here) with some nice findings and interactives. But it isn’t easy to ask deeper questions about your own region or place it in historical/spatial context. Through my experience of trying to do that for SYMCA, I’ve built a range of ways to see what’s in that excel document — and through that process, I’ve come to think we should be able to build better shared tools. Everyone’s asking broadly the same questions, after all — there’s a tonne of wheel-reinvention going on to extract the answers.\nThis is in no way meant as a criticism of ONS, who are doing incredible work getting this data to us and, through ONS Local, supporting regional policymakers. I went on ad nauseum about the “huge value and power” of ONS data at their regional data conference last November.\nIf you’re interested in the nuts and bolts, [this post] runs through some R code to illustrate the point — a pipeline direct from that opaque excel file through to insights in straightforward, reproducible steps. Using the same pipeline, and all in code, we can build reports, maps, dashboards etc. and share them easily. Once we have that, we can puzzle our way to what it means for our regions, what theories of change we believe it supports, what blindspots and problems the data has — but a data platform like this underpinning it smooths the path considerably.\nMore recently, I’ve been re-using these tools to help other Yorkshire government bodies get insights quickly. This came about quite serendipitously, but it’s helped convince me it’s a good way to work. [Explain something about how much it speeds things up / how cost effective it is]\n(This is all on my github where I’m trying to corral more of it into the regecontools site, itself a github repo; the website’s all generated using R.)\nI’m not suggesting how I’ve approached this is anything like the best way - but I am arguing that building these pipelines openly leads to good things that otherwise couldn’t happen. What I’d love to see is what others can do, and what kind of tools we could build together.\nAnd then something on: why the orig data sources are not enough. Just supplying openly isn’t enough. Without capacity to see what’s in that data, you’re still blind. What exactly does that capacity look like and how do we build it?"

After no luck pitching to agents, I lovingly disassembled that draft and put it back together by the following summer in 2022, then churned through another round of agent pitches (also nope).\nA few months later, at the end of 2022, openAI released chatGPT 3.5 for public use. Three years have since passed. That Oatmeal panel above (from this piece) is how a lot of people feel now about AI - there’s a decent chance you’d be willing to pay to make everyone please shut up about it, please stop inserting it into our lives whether we ask for it or no.\nAmid this ceaseless cacophony, I am planning to get the book out into the world. Great timing. I’ve set myself this aim:\nI’ll be re-assessing the book scene by scene in this final loop, writing about the ideas and the construction of it. It has to remain a product of its pre-chatGPT time. It’s a bad idea to let current events blow one’s ideas around like a weathervane. But our brave new LLM world (bubble pop or not) does offer a chance to reflect. How much has it (a) changed how I think about the book and (b) changed how I think about AI and its impact on us?\nAnyone who knows me knows I struggle to see the value of my own work. The book has plenty of flaws, but I’m super-proud of it. This never happens. I feel baffingly, DunningKrugerly confident in it. I’ve worked hard to mix ideas with pace, to write something fun. Your definition of fun may differ, but I think a certain kind of sci-fi fan (i.e. people like me) will dig it. I’m going to roll with that feeling before my brain notices.\nSo stick your email in the subscribe box if…\n(I’ll mark sci-fi related posts, in case you want to avoid other stuff I write about.)\nIn my day-job, I’m now working on analysis of AI workplace impacts. Given that, writing about sci-fi feels a bit like running through town wearing nothing but a fez and a feather boa: equally mortifying and liberating, potentially illegal. But it’s how I was schooled - in the last year of my Sheffield politics degree, Mike Kenny paired social theory with sci-fi every week2. I was introduced there to what’s arguably still my favourite book, Le Guin’s Dispossessed. (We didn’t have to wear just a fez and feather boa in seminars though.) Causal arrows between our imaginations and reality go in all directions (though that has issues - see below)."

When the miners had to use ladders, it would take an hour to climb down to their shift and ninety minutes to reach the surface again (they weren’t paid for that time).

    "text": "Verbal VTT rambles:\nThere’s a map from 1890 of the very centre of Sheffield where the testing works was originally based, partly on stilts over the river Don. It is surrounded on two sides by the Clyde and Mill Sands steel works. The opposite bank of the Don is lined with a huge number of slaughter houses, opposite that is the Alexandra Opera house (more music hall than opera). There are markets to the south and east, and the tendrils of rail and Canal connections reach right into all of it.\n\n\n\nThis small detail that a single piece of faulty metal was sent all the way to Sheffield from Cornwall for testing intrigues me. It was happening at a time in Sheffield where there was both a tension and a joining of practical and scientific happening between steel producers metals and the emerging colleges and universities.\nThe original articles of incorporation for Sheffield testing works are still available on the company’s house website for download if you want to go and look at them. In his recent history, it’s first been absorbed into a larger UK firm, moving off several times over this from the industrial Centre of Sheffield city into a more modern building further out in Rotherham. The majority stake in the UK firm is now owned by a Singapore sovereign wealth fund.\nThe deep history of this firm is in no way captured in the single SIC code on companies’s house: “74909 - Other professional, scientific and technical activities not elsewhere classified”. I’ve scraped data for all live firms in companies house - there’s a ton of incredible information hidden away in there, and using that you can make some fascinating maps of the UK’s economic landscape. But it’s important to remember how surface level this data is, what hidden history lies underneath. We can try and improve the accuracy of that data (for example, through tech analysis of firms websites to create more accurate industrial categories, as data city do). But that hidden history is still vital - not just a series of entertaining anecdotes, but an essential part of understanding why Sheffield’s economy is the shape it is, how deep the roots of its connections go, and how we can build on them now.\n..\nI first heard about Sheffield Testing Works through a random Cornish connection. In 1919, a 16 foot metal rod was sent from the Levant tin and copper mine to be tested in Sheffield. It had failed, causing one of the worst mining disasters in British history.\nThere are threads that run right from Sheffield and South Yorkshire’s past into the present day that will play a role in where we go next. There’s so much I don’t know, so much to learn.\nWhere did the original Sheffield testing Works get its DNA? What parts of that DNA still exist in the city? What did it come to be connected with?\nTo understand the economic ecosystem of a place the data is one bit of the elephant…"

That can be its own thing. I’d love to know what and who else they were testing for and how much has changed.\n..\nWhat kind of piece is this, and what do I want from it? I take the ‘following breadcrumbs’ point, but it might be nice to think about what focus I’d want and what the point is. I have ideas about trying to pitch pieces to the Shef Tribune. That would be something quite different to a free-form piece just exploring the sources.\nIt’s probably OK that I don’t know what ‘the story’ is yet. The tricky part is allowing myself to explore freely without nagging voices: “What are the opportunity costs?? Why are you wasting time??”"

It was installed in 1857. 1000 ft wooden rod. 137 times to get up or down. 30 mins versus 90 mins to climb (and risk falling from exhaustion). https://youtu.be/uH0W5AK4bwI?t=346\nHuh. It was ancient tech - other mines using lifts (don’t think possible in that shaft?) Or two-pole man engines that doubled the speed.\nMen had told management it wasn’t safe…\n5 years since the bracket that broke was replaced.\nThe top 300 foot of the rod broke off and fell into the shaft.\nInteresting: fault identified in the bracket led to it being labelled an ‘accident’, owners not liable. Despite other places having much safer systems. So no compensation to families of dead and injured.\n..\nFrom the original Levant mine man engine report.\nhttps://nmrs.org.uk/mines-map/accidents-disasters/cornwall-devon/accident-at-levant-tin-mine-1919/\n“The balanced load amounted to about 14 tons. When the shift of 150 men were on the rod their weight increased the unbalanced load to about 24 tons.”\n150!!\n“A full investigation took place and the caps which were made of faggotted iron were tested at the Sheffield Testing Works was found to be not uniform in quality owing to the method of manufacture. The inquest and inquiry was opened in the Levant Mining Company’s Offices an occupied two full days and conducted by Mr. Edward Boase, H.M. Coroner for the Western District of the County. All interested parties were represented and the jury brought in the verdict that the men died due to-\nAccidental Death, the cause being the breaking of a strap plate due to fatigue of a defective part of the metal.”\n..\n“Transport of copper ore to Penzance until the 1840s was by mule train, each mule carrying about three hundredweight (150 kilos) in two sacks slung across a wooden pack saddle. In 1836 the Reverend Symonds, visiting Levant, described how “The ore………is sent over the Channel to Swansea for smelting, in sacks about as the thick part of one’s thigh.” So Levant’s first sale of 11 tons (a ton in this case being 21 cwt) would have required 77 mule loads to get it to Penzance. In fact the evidence indicates that the ore was taken to Penzance in sacks but shipped to Swansea loose.”\nhttps://www.penwithlocalhistorygroup.co.uk/on-this-day/?id=93\n\n\nSheffield Testing Works\nHere’s the Companies House entry for (now London registered) Element Materials Technology Sheffield. Note - list of older names includes the original Sheffield Testing Works, from 1903 when it was incorporated. Orig incorporation doc from 1903 here.

(small building in front of Castle Grinding Wheel in the above photographs)” https://www.sheffieldhistory.co.uk/forums/topic/20026-smithfield-market/\nFounded by Thomas Nash: “In 1880 he conceived the idea of establishing an independent testing and experimenting works in Sheffield. He took great pride in turning out accurate work, with the result that his business grew rapidly, and he found it advisable to add a chemical laboratory to his mechanical testing laboratory. In the course of his work he was frequently consulted regarding breakdowns of various kinds.” “Also a member of the Iron and Steel Institute.” https://www.gracesguide.co.uk/Thomas_Nash\nHis son Tom took over but only lived seven years longer than his father. https://www.gracesguide.co.uk/Thomas_Nash_(d.1910)\nhttps://www.28dayslater.co.uk/threads/ferodo-house-sheffield-march-2018.112705/ Element used to be here (urban explorer)\nNow at Magna Way - website has a little of the history.

One does not generally associate with Sheffield, in one’s mind, anything quite so charming in its effect as this striking picture.\n“But if you enter one of the large manufactories for which Sheffield is famous, such as the Cyclops Works of Messrs. Charles Cammell and Co., or the Atlas Works of Messrs. John Brown and Co., or the Works of Messrs. Firth or Messrs. Vickers—names of firms which by no means exhaust the list—you will instantaneously receive a very different set of impressions. \n“It is not too much to say that the keynote of these impressions is one of terror.”\nhttps://decollected.net/novel/pearsons-main/sheffield/\n..\nLater… now subsumed into UK firm Element Materials (wikipedia), which has itself been conglomerated into a Singapore organisation, Temasek holdings.

Wow. Net value as of March 2025 close to 0.5 TRILLION dollars… https://www.temasek.com.sg/en/our-investments/our-portfolio\nThat portfolio site nicely shows what sectors it’s spread across.

    "text": "In my role as a Y-PERN policy fellow over the past couple of years, I’ve been working with South Yorkshire Combined Mayoral Authority and others on data for regional economic thinking. As a result of that, I’ve built up a data toolkit while digging into UK sectors, growth and other econ-adjacent data.\nOver the next six months or so as Y-PERN continues, I want to make this a more focused project. The plan is roughly this:\nI’m gathering data/code/explanations onto a regecontools website, though bits are spread all over. This live outputs page on the techie blog has gathered most of it in one place. (Fun1 example interactive: South Yorkshire’s job count from 2023 BRES data; click to drill down through local authority and sector granularity.)\nThe least tested part of this for me, and maybe the most interesting, is the ‘tools/ideas/questions’ cycle. The tools/concepts we use to make sense of our regional economies have grown from a hodgepodge of ideas. These can be questioned at different levels - from narrowly methodological (“Do existing measures of public sector output capture their real value? Have we understood what impact boundary choice has?”) through to deeper, more political ideas about what economies are and what/who they’re for (see e.g. the latest doughnut economics Nature paper or this survey of over 200 eco-econs/wellbeing indicators).\nY-PERN’s whole purpose has been to experiment with breaking down barriers in this cycle - trying to push past deficit model thinking that just sees that cycle as a “transfer of information from experts to non-experts”. This is still a pretty entrenched view: academics toil in the dark for years, emerge pale and blinking, clutching new insights. A separate ‘knowledge exchange’ process then commences.\nBut that doesn’t align with the reality of data-driven policymaking: everyone involved are experts in what they do. It’s a deeply collaborative endeavour. We don’t all share the same knowledge, but we also won’t progress much without bringing everyone’s together.\nThe ‘open’ part of the toolkit is in symbiosis with the ‘ideas/questions’ part. Regions face many of the same economic questions, including identical asks from central government (e.g. to produce Local Growth Plans). The same data sources are re-used, the same assumptions. At the same time, we’re all working to develop our own identities as devolution deepens. Given that, here’s the philosophy I want to work with:\nI don’t have a dogmatic fealty to open source — we have a data/analysis mixed economy where private providers can do things other can’t, and that’s a good thing. There are also essential datasets that can’t be open, for good reason. But where we can, working in the open just goes better with the grain of those three things: (1) collaborative learning/capacity building across silos; (2) developing our shared sense of ground truth; (3) avoiding wheel reinvention (a facet of reproducibility, which needs open methods; you can’t reproduce something if you can’t access it).\nThe only way this works is if we prototype. Or call that test and learn if you prefer. As that doc says:\nSounds great in principle - but we have to be open to our preconceptions being challenged when we smack into reality. The Valve Games employee manual puts it like this2:\nWhile not always comfortable, this is part of how to grow our shared sense of ground truth by working together. It’s perfect ‘blind people and elephant’ parable territory3. Brace for an extremely mixed elephant/economy metaphor.\nCombining openness and prototyping, though, we can exchange what we think we’ve seen with others, maybe learn from our errors, and move a step or two closer to a collective sense of shape.\nThen there are awkward people saying things like, “Are we sure this is an elephant? I think maybe we have to go back to first principles here.” But again - an open, testing approach lets us argue our competing pachyderm theories out, and often discover diverse tools can be used in different places very effectively despite no total agreement.\nThat can hit up against very different incentives and cadences across academia and policymaking (as SYMCA’s Alice Rubbra lays out here really clearly) - but those are other elements to test as we go. What mix of relationships and structures can we grow to get closer to truly learning, adaptive regions?\nSo, what next? I’ll need to keep things fairly narrow to achieve anything at all, most likely by testing some ONS and Companies-House-extracted economy measures, see what can be improved, what blind spots there are. I’ll also try to find two or three focused problems to apply this to - including, I’m hoping, something on how we close the gap between quant views of sector mix and ground level knowledge of how firms interact, and what difference that makes to their success.\nUnderlying-idea-wise, I’d like to see how older theories of technical changes in production can help shed light on current AI fears (I’m also working on an AI impact project). That could help think through where we want economic progress to come from.\nLet’s see how contact with reality changes things…"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Douglas Adams said:\nThis is exactly the kind of productivity thinking the country needs, I think. I’ve been trying to follow his example recently. I am trying to disassemble how I do things / why I’m doing them / whether I should I just sit in my pants all day eating pringles / what sort of task-environment-brain re-jigs might help answer any of those questions. This is leading to many “all day programming for a ten second task” moments.\nIt’s all part of joining in the currently very fashionable and exciting pastime of “wondering what kind of brain I have and whether it really needs to have been so bloody difficult all this time.” (Analogy: as a left-hander, if I’d always been made to use my right hand, as was the case pre 1950ish.) Coming at it like a design problem, prototyping things that may end up on the scrapheap, is the only way.\nSo rather than get on with, say, actually working on the sci-fi book or writing about anything concrete, I’ve done the following:\nSo now the process of writing a blog post couldn’t be simpler. I just (1) write it in Obsidian as I’m doing now; (2) use the Obsidian-to-Quarto export function; (3) in RStudio, run the R function to convert exobrain links and YAML and move the files; (4) when in a state I’m happy to publish, move it manually to the posts folder (that could be streamlined); (5) run ‘render’ on that final post in RStudio so the HTML goes to the docs folder; (6) git stage/commit and push in Gitraken to get it live on coveredinbees. Done! Just like that. Substack schmubschmack.\nSigh. I am reminded a little of the Mars Curiosity Rover’s landing plan (in one of my all time favourite youtube videos, recorded before they knew whether it would succeed). Aim for a flat spot, use Mars’ atmosphere to slow down a little (it’s 1% the density of Earth’s), use a huge parachute, release a cap to view the ground, drop the rover carried by its own rocket stage because none of that can slow it down enough, but you can’t use rockets to land because the dust will bugger the rover’s systems - so hover above the ground and lower it on four wires, and then boost the rocket stage off to the side so it doesn’t crash on top of the now-on-Mars Curiosity. Oh and do all that entirely automatically because signals to Mars were a 14 minute round trip at the time. Done! Just like that. Elon Schmelon.\nHere’s Jazz-student turned NASA entry/descent/landing lead Adam Steltzner:\nReasoned engineering thought, though, takes a lot of testing. The problem with testing human brains, or at least mine, is the tendency to default to “you’re just a useless idiot” and stop at that, rather than taking little steps, inching forward, playing, trying new things, seeing what goes with the grain, what rubs against it. It needs resetting daily as the self-blame module can be deeply wired in - previous perceived failures obviously a personal failure, says the module, rather than allowing consideration of the whole you/task/environment setup1.\nSo while I’m obviously getting those sweet sweet Douglas Adams Dopamine Hits from all this ridiculous tinkering, it’s… not entirely ridiculous. None of this is novel - here’s a nice writeup of the general digital garden idea, it’s in that ballpark. The world is littered with failed ‘Systems That Will Solve Everything’, but maybe there’s merit in this kind of slow, tentative gardening.\nAll the ‘digital garden’ tech is allowing is easy linkage - it’s been described as ‘your own personal wikipedia’. But replicating existing links would seem pointless, no? So the test here is: can it be used to add little modular chunks, questions, connections? In a way that isn’t just building an ideas oubliette? What, if anything, can it really add?\nI’m finding that when you start playing with the task/environment/self parts, they all start affecting each other in unexpected ways. One of the most intriguing: what it’s doing to what I think words are actually for. That’s led to a List of writing questions (see, nice exobrain link; sorry, some LLM assistance in that list). There’s a long section on different functions of writing where “narrow professional words” are in the minority. There’s also writing for one’s own brain/ psychology/emotions; connection; experimentation; identity building…\nThat rather solipsistic view segues into bigger veins and arteries we all share. I tried “Writing” about that - it’s got some of the ideas there, but… too much. Let’s see if it’s possible to pick away at it more slowly. It feels like a very specific historical moment for language, when humans have lost their monopoly on the written word (people pointing that out here, here, here), when the collective lighthouses we used to steer away from the Deathly Rocks of Bullshit are under well-funded, sustained attack.\nThat’s enough to make it feel like finding your own words is pointless. Working theory: it isn’t, it’s more important than ever. So let’s add that one to the list for later:"

    "text": "Over the past couple of years, I’ve been building up a loose ‘regional economics’ toolkit while digging into UK sectors, growth and other econ-adjacent data (working mainly with SYMCA wearing my Y-PERN hat)1.\nI’m gathering data/code/explanations onto a regecontools website, though bits are spread all over. This live outputs page on the techie blog has gathered most of it in one place. (Fun2 example interactive: South Yorkshire’s job count from 2023 BRES data; click to drill down through local authority and sector granularity.)\nOver the next six months or so, I want to make this a more focused project. The plan is roughly this:\nThe least tested part of this for me, and maybe the most interesting, is the ‘tools/ideas/questions’ cycle. The tools/concepts we use to make sense of our regional economies have grown from a hodgepodge of ideas. These can be questioned at different levels - from narrowly methodological (“Do existing measures of public sector output capture their real value? Have we understood what impact boundary choice has?”) through to deeper, more political ideas about what economies are and what/who they’re for (see e.g. the latest doughnut economics Nature paper or this survey of over 200 eco-econs/wellbeing indicators).\nY-PERN’s whole purpose has been to experiment with breaking down barriers in this cycle - trying to push past deficit model thinking that just sees that cycle as a “transfer of information from experts to non-experts”. This is still a pretty entrenched view: academics toil in the dark for years, emerge pale and blinking, clutching new insights. A separate ‘knowledge exchange’ process then commences.\nBut that doesn’t align with the reality of data-driven policymaking: everyone involved are experts in what they do. It’s a deeply collaborative endeavour. We don’t all share the same knowledge, but we also won’t progress much without bringing everyone’s together.\nThe ‘open’ part of the toolkit is in symbiosis with the ‘ideas/questions’ part. Regions face many of the same economic questions, including identical asks from central government (e.g. to produce Local Growth Plans). The same data sources are re-used, the same assumptions. At the same time, we’re all working to develop our own identities as devolution deepens. Given that, here’s the philosophy I want to work with:\nI don’t have a dogmatic fealty to open source — we have a data/analysis mixed economy where private providers can do things other can’t, and that’s a good thing. There are also essential datasets that can’t be open, for good reason. But where we can, working in the open just goes better with the grain of those three things: (1) collaborative learning/capacity building across silos; (2) developing our shared sense of ground truth; (3) avoiding wheel reinvention (a facet of reproducibility, which needs open methods; you can’t reproduce something if you can’t access it).\nThe only way this works is if we prototype. Or call that test and learn if you prefer. As that doc says:\nSounds great in principle - but we have to be open to our preconceptions being challenged when we smack into reality. The Valve Games employee manual puts it like this3:\nWhile not always comfortable, this is part of how to grow our shared sense of ground truth by working together. It’s perfect ‘blind people and elephant’ parable territory4. Brace for an extremely mixed elephant/economy metaphor.\nCombining openness and prototyping, though, we can exchange what we think we’ve seen with others, maybe learn from our errors, and move a step or two closer to a collective sense of shape.\nThen there are awkward people saying things like, “Are we sure this is an elephant? I think maybe we have to go back to first principles here.” But again - an open, testing approach lets us argue our competing pachyderm theories out, and often discover diverse tools can be used in different places very effectively despite no total agreement.\nThat can hit up against very different incentives and cadences across academia and policymaking (as SYMCA’s Alice Rubbra lays out here really clearly) - but those are other elements to test as we go. What mix of relationships and structures can we grow to get closer to truly learning, adaptive regions?\nSo, what next? I’ll need to keep things fairly narrow to achieve anything at all, most likely by testing some ONS and Companies-House-extracted economy measures, see what can be improved, what blind spots there are. I’ll also try to find two or three focused problems to apply this to - including, I’m hoping, something on how we close the gap between quant views of sector mix and ground level knowledge of how firms interact, and what difference that makes to their success.\nUnderlying-idea-wise, I’d like to see how older theories of technical changes in production can help shed light on current AI fears (I’m also working on an AI impact project). That could help think through where we want economic progress to come from.\nLet’s see how contact with reality changes things. Stick your email in the subscribe box to follow along…"

    "section": "",
    "text": "I wrote a sci-fi book about artificial intelligence. I started the research for it in 2018, from an idea I’d had in 2012. A first draft was done by mid 2021. After no luck pitching to agents, I lovingly disassembled that draft and put it back together by the following summer in 2022, then churned through another round of agent pitches (also nope).\nA few months later, at the end of 2022, openAI released chatGPT 3.5 for public use. Three years have since passed. That Oatmeal panel above (from this piece) is how a lot of people feel now about AI - there’s a decent chance you’d be willing to pay to make everyone please shut up about it, please stop inserting it into our lives whether we ask for it or no.\nAmid this ceaseless cacophony, I am planning to get the book out into the world. Great timing. I’ve set myself this aim:\nI’ll be re-assessing the book scene by scene in this final loop, writing about the ideas and the construction of it. It has to remain a product of its pre-chatGPT time. It’s a bad idea to let current events blow one’s ideas around like a weathervane. But our brave new LLM world (bubble pop or not) does offer a chance to reflect. How much has it (a) changed how I think about the book and (b) changed how I think about AI and its impact on us?\nI’ll be journaling progress as I go in this planning/work doc (partly to be open, partly a post-LLM urge to demonstrate the flailing human frightfulness of the process).\nAnyone who knows me knows I struggle to see the value of my own work. The book has plenty of flaws, but I’m super-proud of it. This never happens. I feel baffingly, DunningKrugerly confident in it. I’ve worked hard to mix ideas with pace, to write something fun. Your definition of fun may differ, but I think a certain kind of sci-fi fan (i.e. people like me) will dig it. I’m going to roll with that feeling before my brain notices.\nSo stick your email in the subscribe box if…\n(I’ll mark sci-fi related posts, in case you want to avoid other stuff I write about.)\nIn my day-job, I’m now working on analysis of AI workplace impacts. Given that, writing about sci-fi feels a bit like running through town wearing nothing but a fez and a feather boa: equally mortifying and liberating, potentially illegal. But it’s how I was schooled - in the last year of my Sheffield politics degree, Mike Kenny paired social theory with sci-fi every week2. I was introduced there to what’s arguably still my favourite book, Le Guin’s Dispossessed. (We didn’t have to wear just a fez and feather boa in seminars though.) Causal arrows between our imaginations and reality go in all directions (though that has issues - see below)."

    "text": "Draft questions / sub-questions\n\nIn a given region, either with multiple or a single main centre, how do you answer the following: should we promote growth of the ‘core city’ or main centre, as agglomeration effects will spread out into wider region? Or should we promote growth across regions in the same way? [Bouncing off WM argument]\n\nThe question here includes: if growth happens, where do the benefits flow? Who to? What makes a difference there? What data do we have to understand that and in what ways might be data be misleading or just plain wrong? [That’s a general one for everything…]\n\n\n“Since his election last year, Mayor Richard Parker has been very clear that growth in the West Midlands must be ‘Growth for Everyone’. Despite agglomeration theories being the prevailing model of economic growth for several decades, they have very little to say about the distribution of wealth and we see stark economic inequalities as a consequence.”\nVia Ed Cox responding to Paul Swinney’s CFC post. Other links: LinkedIn, Adam Brown’s original post that gets to all the others. (“This is excellent and I’m glad one of our most important economic geographies is smart enough to see through the usual simplistic (and now massively outdated) agglomeration theories.”)"

    "text": "Douglas Adams said:\nThis is exactly the kind of productivity thinking the country needs, I think. I’ve been trying to follow his example recently. I am trying to disassemble how I do things / why I’m doing them / whether I should I just sit in my pants all day eating pringles / what sort of task-environment-brain re-jigs might help answer any of those questions. This is leading to many “all day programming for a ten second task” moments.\nIt’s all part of joining in the currently very fashionable and exciting pastime of “wondering what kind of brain I have and whether it really needs to have been so bloody difficult all this time.” (Analogy: as a left-hander, if I’d always been made to use my right hand, as was the case pre 1950ish.) Coming at it like a design problem, prototyping things that may end up on the scrapheap, is the only way.\nSo rather than get on with, say, actually working on the sci-fi book or writing about anything concrete, I’ve done the following:\nSo now the process of writing a blog post couldn’t be simpler. I just (1) write it in Obsidian as I’m doing now; (2) use the Obsidian-to-Quarto export function; (3) in RStudio, run the R function to convert exobrain links and YAML and move the files; (4) when in a state I’m happy to publish, move it manually to the posts folder (that could be streamlined); (5) run ‘render’ on that final post in RStudio so the HTML goes to the docs folder; (6) git stage/commit and push in Gitraken to get it live on coveredinbees. Done! Just like that. Substack schmubschmack.\nSigh. I am reminded a little of the Mars Curiosity Rover’s landing plan (in one of my all time favourite youtube videos, recorded before they knew whether it would succeed). Aim for a flat spot, use Mars’ atmosphere to slow down a little (it’s 1% the density of Earth’s), use a huge parachute, release a cap to view the ground, drop the rover carried by its own rocket stage because none of that can slow it down enough, but you can’t use rockets to land because the dust will bugger the rover’s systems - so hover above the ground and lower it on four wires, and then boost the rocket stage off to the side so it doesn’t crash on top of the now-on-Mars Curiosity. Oh and do all that entirely automatically because signals to Mars were a 14 minute round trip at the time. Done! Just like that. Elon Schmelon.\nHere’s Jazz-student turned NASA entry/descent/landing lead Adam Steltzner:\nReasoned engineering thought, though, takes a lot of testing. The problem with testing human brains, or at least mine, is the tendency to default to “you’re just a useless idiot” and stop at that, rather than taking little steps, inching forward, playing, trying new things, seeing what goes with the grain, what rubs against it. It needs resetting daily as the self-blame module can be deeply wired in - previous perceived failures obviously a personal failure, says the module, rather than allowing consideration of the whole you/task/environment setup1.\nSo while I’m obviously getting those sweet sweet Douglas Adams Dopamine Hits from all this ridiculous tinkering, it’s… not entirely ridiculous. None of this is novel - here’s a nice writeup of the general digital garden idea, it’s in that ballpark. The world is littered with failed ‘Systems That Will Solve Everything’, but maybe there’s merit in this kind of slow, tentative gardening.\nAll the ‘digital garden’ tech is allowing is easy linkage - it’s been described as ‘your own personal wikipedia’. But replicating existing links would seem pointless, no? So the test here is: can it be used to add little modular chunks, questions, connections? In a way that isn’t just building an ideas oubliette? What, if anything, can it really add?\nI’m finding that when you start playing with the task/environment/self parts, they all start affecting each other in unexpected ways. One of the most intriguing: what it’s doing to what I think words are actually for. That’s led to a [[List of writing questions]] (see, nice exobrain link; sorry, some LLM assistance in that list). There’s a long section on different [[List of writing questions#Functions of writing expanding the available options|functions of writing]] where “narrow professional words” are in the minority. There’s also writing for one’s own brain/ psychology/emotions; connection; experimentation; identity building…\nThat rather solipsistic view segues into bigger veins and arteries we all share. I tried “Writing” about that - it’s got some of the ideas there, but… too much. Let’s see if it’s possible to pick away at it more slowly. It feels like a very specific historical moment for language, when humans have lost their monopoly on the written word (people pointing that out here, here, here), when the collective lighthouses we used to steer away from the Deathly Rocks of Bullshit are under well-funded, sustained attack.\nThat’s enough to make it feel like finding your own words is pointless. Working theory: it isn’t, it’s more important than ever. So let’s add that one to the list for later:"

Then, very very untested suggestion - the “magic” seen in Bali etc is same as “magic” of following market rules, both involving internalisation of heuristics over time.

The final split, which is going to be after Hill gets into school - happens when she’s young, remember, and may involve having to go to different place, be with dad. It could be drifting apart at the point. The red toy exchange happens after that - is hill too small there?\nJust reading hexaflex again. Am reminded - part of what makes John’s thread work is being carried along with what John’s going through, seeing this from this POV. That’s compelling in itself, some internal justification for its existence. The difficult is the psychological realism. How could someone possibly react in a situation like that?

    "text": "Notes from last read-through [1.11.25]\nFrom the blue/red stripey notebook. Shit, I have to try and read my hand writing.\n\nLast note first, after returning months later: the opening is opaque and baffling. “How to do the same thing, or not at all? How to do in way that actually draws reader in? It’s in there, just needs knocking about. Cf. p.130”how important the story is”. Nice idea for beginning too.”\nNeed better Ipai intro in first Hill section (think I’ve got plan for that, tying into making Tru better too).\n“Someone owns every concept and every story.” (“Explain why seems dystopian but isn’t,” it says here!)\nMore Tru: have him explain more about how exactly he got into debt. (Ties again to bigger aims for that char, the bet..) Who hard-sold him?\nLab destruction - motivation is still tepid/opaque/out of the blue/out of place. Is it? All of that might need some rethinking, in combo with Tru. What actually are the stakes, is it possible to gain early understanding of why Hill might do that? (Or was it a pantsing too far?)\n\nWhat would be compelling? What’s whole hill structure/arc?\n\np.84: Hill - “Work was destroyed”. Can I think through a better thing to convey the hole she’s in? What kind of hole is she actually in anyway? This is classic Princess falls on hard times type thing isn’t it?\n\nHow to get the reader into Hill’s head on this? Plus, does it actually make sense? (Did something else pre-date it, how does it fit with fam history?)\nActually does get good post-lab-destroy: Just gotta get there. “Proposal” is great, lab destroy does work as instigating wotsit. But…\n\np.93: “Petulance so powerful”: piece Hill’s story together. [Huh? Make it make sense with everything else?]\nReally need to show how much losing IP access fucks things. That’s the job of the Tru thread, no? Do I actually know how it fucks things?\n129: “needs sunlight of attention”. Is there any way to get nature of IP thing right at beginning? Again, every Hill section should be doing that at the start. Go through and be clear on what each is achieving in rel2 that. Write that down. That’s in “the plan” - can def get some of it into e.g. the Axiom Hack and the exhibition. And how it differs still from the street, its relative safety and playfulness?\nSays here: hmm - street convo in ‘seed planting’ could do half the job of the axiom hack seminar, maybe. Most of it. Could be right near start, properly show off the voice system.\n\nHow though? What would happen near the start? Does Tru actually come along, bring someone else? That might work, esp if he’s coming to egg on, push Hill into making mistakes. He might bring someone who doesn’t have so many restrictions. Leveraging connections. (Can he pass paper notes, or is that not allowed for some reason? Could make that entertaining - Hill can call him out, he can shrug, his accomplice can say, “There’s nothing to stop me saying what I want. What I want just happens to be what’s written on this piece of paper.” But then, what is Tru trying to achieve? Win a bet? Maybe. Maybe he’s not so nice after all.\n\nThis is nice to read: “Am reading A-B and remembering why I wrote this, how much it does exactly what I wanted.”\n“Can I up the AI gen aspects of Terry Saucer?” Yeah there’s a lot there to think through too.\n179: How to sell IP - where Tru tells Hill a lot of stuff it might be good to show. [Let’s see - full check on Tru’s thread, may well be possible to do this as we go.] Instead, this scene could be picking apart what’s happening.\n“Street” is confusing term, possibly? Better?\nMore of an arc for Remzi: how to connect that to the levels? What’s his relation with street level? Am I clear in my own mind all the diff social rels there, layers in the school, where everyone fits and what their function is in the story? Esp given I want Tru to have a larger role there.\nSays here: “Consider all points Tru making p.178.” What are those? Just I think about his and Hill’s differences.\nI could do with doing something to make the school more tangible, weirder, more baroque. A large dark academia rabbit hole awaits.\nSome of the street people Hill connects to - tie to what Rem/Hill do, then maybe have it show up with cx2 what John’s layer becomes.\nBetter word than “context”? Clique?\np.183 = good (IP / getting laid). Something like that nearer to the beginning? Lay out intro to how the whole system works?\nPredator prey: give them a touch more life? [Do they really need it? Dunno. Connect to John’s memories? (The shark memory, introduce the ocean book earlier, so it’s not so suddenly introduced. And can be John applying memory at different levels.) Shadow of sharks, all teeth and knife-sharp focus? Add noise, hiding in dark of trees.\nSays here: “brief chat with I + B at start.” (Of predator prey. Why / what for?)\nCauliflower: path of discovery could do with being smoothed out and clarified. Reader needs to be clear why we’re now talking about DNA. Depict actual DNA strands and RNA reading. Take time. [And think about what this is trying to achieve - might be that dropping the romanesque is sensible. Who the hell is going to know what I’m talking about there? But what else would do the job? Something else that turns up again later.]\n\nHexaflex: “You saw how vital geog is for protein function.” Depict that in cauli plz, in some way.\n\nOne millimetre: it’s only a page, but how the new IP thing is communicated is still overly flowery. Would prefer something else. See note P.391. [OK, what does that say? “Can this be massively cut down? It’s confusing and self-indulgent.” Well that doesn’t sound good!] One suggestion I have here: have Hill/John translate Ipai’s pompous twattery into pisstaking English.\n\nOoo note: same page, some def franken overtones here on how the skin’s assembled from different people. I can say something about trying to find all commonalities, use some statistics language.\n\nSays here p.423, “looking skin” got dropped. But it totally didn’t, appears also on p.391. I do need to consider what I think the frankenskin thing is, how best to convey it (to myself included).\n\nOther thoughts as they occur:\n\nThe other animal people - they appear to make a single point but can’t they do more? Be more of a part of what they all get combined to become? That does happen as John blends with them, but what does that mean for the connectome?\n\nAh yes, this turns up in previous notes: “J’s false memories just make me think there’s a better book where those connections have more plot meaning.” Yes."

A thought: make John / Hill comms more explicit early on. John trying to help Hill find him, track him down, work out what’s happening. That would allow Hill and Remzi to try to figure out more clues, and provide some basis for John to poke at things that might help reveal. Ipai still gets to know comms have been happening? That needs mulling too.\n..\nRichard Whittle: https://theconversation.com/what-could-burst-the-ai-bubble-267136\nA thought off the back of that - can I trace a line of tech dev from this, through all the IP stuff, to the IPAI and voice system? [That part’s a bit odd and extreme, but that’s the fun thought experiment part.] p.s. I need to check Black Mirror hasn’t yet done it!\n..\nJohn: wall is holographic. It’s just him, easy nuff for 3D. Not until much later (house memories) that he’s open that he knows it’s his dad. I might want to get their mum into this story somehow better too.\nThat means changing what happens when it becomes apparent it’s not just holographic, it’s interacting with it. That has lots of possibilities including what ipai is pursuing. What are options here?\n..\n“This film suffers from what I call”mystery box syndrome” - it thinks that withholding information automatically makes a story compelling, regardless of whether the actual answers are worth the wait.” https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/1mnmshm/weapons_2025_am_i_missing_something_this_movie/\nThis is a good point. Mull. “Oh, they’re brother and sister. Yeah that’s a thing that could happen.” That’s less interesting, isn’t it, than what we can get story-wise from that relationship, or how they try to find each other. Also letting the reader know early on (opening) means that’s got some tension to it. But what to give away, what not to?\n..\n“Musk is selling science fiction. Hence the cyber truck design, the Murderbot androids, and HAL the computer AGI. It will be med beds next.” https://www.ft.com/content/21ec5a5f-0e9a-49b9-b64d-9ebc88e70aa7?commentID=13b1fcbf-e51f-4890-9e56-0616390d1f75\nAs in: robot pods that cure you. Prob need a bit more background on that in my head for the book! Cf. Alysium [only thing holding back curing poor is not allowing it / artificial scarcity of healthcare.]\n..\nMore on their mum and dad: maybe dad’s lens / hologram tech was a key breakthrough for AI learning? Prob not cos we don’t want that to be so recent… could that many changes happen that quickly. Would be good to involve / flesh out ma side too.\n.. Back story - lean more into “AI was used to create structure that”solved” polarisation and emergent fascism” (subtly!) .. Second (?) John scene where he brings up his grandma’s talkbox, mulls thinking Medic’s a person - it’s clumsy (and only there to link to later). I need to much more carefully think through what he says here and why / how it ties to the person idea I’m bringing up elsewhere (with mucho LLM overlap of course).\nBut how to do light-touch personhood thing? Maybe make it flippant. “I can anthropomorphise anything. I got guilt about taking my old washing machine to be scrapped. School trained us on this but I can’t help it. I’m more like my grandma….” But the point? ..\nFor the Judy mulling. https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4626276#paper-citations-widget See e.g. file:///home/dano/Downloads/ssrn-5098708.pdf - “Judge AI: Assessing Large Language Models in Judicial Decision-Making” (Will AI judges replace humans? Nope.)\n.\nIt will need a better theory of provenance guarantees. Polly and Judy have that built in. (Just thinking about Dunt’s concern here: “I got an image of the person compiling a series of Chat GPT inquiries. ’Please provide a list of the kind of people it would be suitable to approach about this topic, along with a short description of their professional work.” ” https://substack.com/app-link/post?publication_id=1833442&post_id=171638661&utm_source=post-email-title\nIn the book, that’s not happening - which suggests something occurred to draw lines around what AI was and wasn’t allowed to do, while AI manages it [sidepoint: someone has to point out - other places have vastly different approaches; that should be in the auction maybe… oh I say that below too]. I then need reasons why anyone would trust just voices over a phone. How does Judy/Polly monitor that, or say they do? If it’s as strong as physics, how has Ipai got round it?\nOne idea then: used Bernard as a proxy, got far enough into the brain stuff to be able to use him. That gives him another small role. How can I make that as weird as possible? It also means he could even be in the room with Hill - the buzzer is the door. And that makes their meeting at the end more interesting.\nThe polly/judy conditions for the law may be watertight, so that Bernard work would have to fit - the speech would on some level need to be his. Also makes Medic saying “we did some hacky stuff”, can hint at, is more fun. And then law updated after of course.\nOr hint at that, but then it could just be an earpiece! Old fashioned way. Except that should be illegal right? Something in Judy that says: words “must originate from a human mind”. These are the limits of agent use, just to protect ownership. How this changes the writers’ room, I am not sure.\nYeah, no, make a really weird elaborate way around the physics-like legal restrictions. Judy/Polly not omniscient, and some protection in uni grounds still.\nOh yes of course - Dunt points out: “The Voight-Kampff test - basically the Turing test - is established to distinguish replicants from humans based on their emotional responses.” So that needs a little thought about what we’re saying here… [also, it’s not basically the turing test!]\nOther parts of the world can have very different mixes of this. Can lay out all the range of pol types - full dystopia, places with “free agents” etc. Can have some hint about how this particular settlement arose.\n..\nWriters room: they ban AI use (except that’s ridiculous cos ipai manages it and entai makes it… entai!)\n“But they’re NOT their own thoughts.” “They think they are tho.”\nSo react when it appears Hill is cheating. “Are you using an earpiece? You fucker, that gets us banned!” “Wait though, we’re winning.” But then get over it when they see how much they’re winning.\nUpdate thought on that: it’s a contrast to what’s happened elsewhere, where entai is basically the monopolist, feeding off inputs from everywhere and churning out anything that’s required. Think that through some more, and what relationship “creators” might want to have to that.\nSo they believe they’re being authentic in this situation, despite it being a managed network (how do the talking heads for the shows work? Maybe it’s shifted… if there ended up being a law meaning that “meaning” had to originate in human thought, for example.)\nWhich is maybe what several of the situations are about - checking for human input, but the blend of that with machines blah. Is there something interesting to do there?\nThe Writers’ room should really bounce off this kind of thing: “I’ve spent decades writing and editing; I know the feeling — of reward and hard-won clarity — that writing produces for me. But if you never build those muscles, will you grasp what’s missing when an L.L.M. delivers a chirpy but shallow reply? What happens to students who’ve never experienced the reward of pressing toward an elusive thought that yields itself in clear syntax?”But the generation growing up with A.I. will learn to think and write in its shadow. For them, the chatbot won’t be a tool to discover — as Netscape was for me — but part of the operating system itself. And that shift, from novelty to norm, is the profound transformation we’re only beginning to grapple with.” https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/18/opinion/ai-chatgpt-school.html\n..\nIntro: make clear it’s obvious things aren’t going to turn out well for the protagonist, that it’s obviously not face value. Link to reader somehow.\nVia this linus vid: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGIpdiQrFDU 10’10’’ - “AI is so wrongly used, when AI actually arrives, going to have to give it a different name” Interesting. So actually IPAI etc might have different name. What would it be? What are the options?\nIt’s also interesting discussion of marketers “knowing what people will think when they hear AI”, that they’re doing it on purpose.\n..\n“The internet died not because people can be fooled by manipulated media - that’s always been true. It died because synthetic media, like that created by Sora, ChatGPT, midjourney and others - can emulate human creativity at a scope and scale that is impossible for humans to engage with or sift through.” https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaVjQFMg7L0 Book: infopocalypse. Cites example of Russian tactic of flooding with any information just to drown signal with noise. “Generative A.l Is the nuclear bomb of the information age.”\nSome extra plot based on identity theft e.g Crispin Glover and others\n..\nReplace lecture scene with: same room, but new students. First class? Wowing them? Open day? IP rep has to be there to make clear how all that works for uni. Noah is… monitoring? (It’s an exhibition, which is close to open day…)\nOr actually viva: testing them openly. Think through how that mixes with where tech went re. How they use it. [Yes, like this. Public viva? Oh yes, again, see below!]\nGives chance for playing out some tired IPs e.g. Hill is playing the “rebel who refuses to tow the line” cliches etc etc (better versions of that!)\nMaybe a mix of prospective students and IP reps. Mull.\nAND: something like a Viva. Papers are absolutely besides the point now - maybe have a paper spat out / think about what knoweldge system would be there, but the point is – Viva because have to guarantee human input into that knowledge creation. The entire exhibition is like this, as is auction of course. Think through a bit. Retrofit.\nUse all this to better build up to Hill trashing lab. Why is uni now so headfucking that it’ll get her to that point? Try and make severity of what’s happened much more clear, so the lab itself is the effect of the inciting incident, not the thing itself.\nNote: if it’s Remzi’s viva, the lab destruction sets them against each other, puts him in quite a different situation. What would it be / how would that play out? “They put my promotion on hold.” “No!” Hmm not sure I want to lean further into academia nonsense TBH!\n..\nBand names tru bet: tie it to start with to something in next class, so there’s stakes there. Then tie to things unravelling for hill, and tru’s response.\nTru can also be a bit of gambler, partly why it went wrong for him. (Compare to Nate Silver / River thing?)\nAcross line, tru can make names up, other two refuse or become quiet. “Go on try.” See a bit what happens. Explain context a bit.\nActually, expand this. Tie to point below about hierarchy in school itself. Tru illustrates point by making them play Band Names either side of the line. One addition: either an extra person, or probably Remzi doesn’t have same privileges as Hill [no he doesn’t before Viva!] - so actually it costs him on that side of the line. They don’t know it’s there. Remzi does.\nThat’s not a bad idea - viva can be Remzi getting extra privileges. Or Hill. Gonna have to piece that together.\n(Remzi makes sense as it’ll give more opps for building in tensions between them, things to work from, rather than adding fourth person.)\nAnd it makes more sense why they always go outside line.\nAnd! Maybe tru needs girlf who’s outside line cos of moral choice / authents (authentic humans only zero other input but then do they do work randomising? Do we see that?)\n..\nDifficulty of researching poisons given IPAI system…? (Or not actually - make the point that it’s NOT about surveillance.)\n..\nAdd in some people with a mildly fanatical devotion to making sure their creative endeavours are untouched by machine. [See above, Tru’s girlfriend / boyfriend]\n..\nAnimals stories and how they end up involving John: I think maybe nope. They have to have more reason, more actual plot reason, to exist, rather than just making a point about memory? Do they? But what? [Point about relative intelligence and personhood nonsense!]\n..\nFamous father thing should come up again for Hill, maybe in first class. But why? What consequences? Some already built in.\n…\nA class of people in the school (support, estate, cleaning) with no library privileges who can’t speak quite so easily. Turn up after lab trashed, other points? More on the metabolism of the building. Is one of them… Bernie? Some reason for being there? [Ooo! Like!]\n…\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_academia “One writer compared it to the contemporary cottagecore lifestyle aesthetic, saying that while cottagecore requires a home in the country and leisure time for crafting, dark academia’s”simple act of putting on a blazer and reading Dostoevsky is far more doable.”\nMulling, in relation to how the uni goes / Hill’s rel to it, how she has to consiously shape herself and her view of herself given IPAI, and how that gets warped and twisted by Noah and others.\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/TheSecretHistory/comments/1akn5pf/the_secret_history_is_very_disappointing_but/ “the secret history doesn’t deconstruct dark academia, it is dark academia. it’s the popularity of the secret history (alongside the 2014 film kill your darlings) on tumblr during the early to mid 2010s that gave rise to the term “dark academia.” you can see both stories are very much about seemingly sophisticated and cultured university students going off the rails and committing brutal acts, hence the “dark” bit.”\n“But”dark academia” as the fashion/social trend isn’t inevitably murderous. It’s a cool aesthetic that people fetishise.” Yeah - can imagine some people on the Street doing this, right? What’s the uni’s position to that? What am I doing with that?\n..\n“Abba’s Björn Ulvaeus, the actor Julianne Moore, the Radiohead singer Thom Yorke are among 10,500 signatories of a statement from the creative industries warning artificial intelligence companies that unlicensed use of their work is a “major, unjust threat” to artists’ livelihoods.” https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/oct/22/thom-yorke-and-julianne-moore-join-thousands-of-creatives-in-ai-warning\nPERFECT. Then we get dev of AI driven systems to “make sure everyone gets to own their IP” and away we go. [So much more, what with other lawsuits, pirated books etc.]\n..\nBernie: dupes Hill into “checking” that he’s the person she’s working with, not Ipai. Common protocols to check identity and she fails. Otherwise - why would she trust the other person as not AI? What’s the crack here?\n..\nUse ZRAIN protein chat as opening? [What??]\nLINKS! * https://www.careful.industries/blog/2025-4-what-we-talk-about-when-we-talk-about-ai * The language in this abstract is kind of exactly the nonsense that could happen at the auction plus in IPAI-academia. Just awful! How did we get there? Fitting into epistemes oh no I’m doing it! http://www.richard-hall.org/2024/02/15/generative-ai-and-re-weaving-a-pedagogical-horizon-of-social-possibility/\n..\nAI and IPAI: if LLMs don’t “understand” language and meaning… what innovations led later AI to have symbolic understanding? How did it demonstrate it? (Issue of how to know, that overlaps with what IPAI is trying to do with John, and why digging deeper into the language side does actually overlap this overall story.) (And why Symbolic species is so key; and why I got tricked into thinking LLMs did have symbolic understanding.)\n..\nThere’s increasingly absolutely no way to separate AI output from human speech even if verbal? Entirely mixed. Same as diff betw those old shoe makers and newer tech; so the writers’ room is a facet of that (tho an entirely weird and false one). See e.g. https://archive.ph/eMUYW\nThe written word - did it die? Is that why writers’ room so weird? It’s why vivas happening.\n[How does that tie into John reading the book / writing there?]\n..\nBouncing off this: the “going into your mind to achieve some story goal” cliche. https://youtu.be/4-pnloXSNrI?t=1787 How to do something with that that’s actually interesting and useful and that does something good with the animal people? Hmmmm."

Most of these I think can be keyhole surgery rather than butchery, but let’s see. Some nabbed from above, some thought of since.\n\nJohn’s thread:\n\nConsider the whole thing, look for ways to develop more narrative drive. Difficult given its nature, but not impossible - there’s a lot to tie to in the rest of the book. Various options including beginning the connection with Hill earlier, turning that more into a discovery process, figuring out the clues. It may not need that much.\n\nProvenance:\n\nThis needs more thought than I’ve given it. Hill wouldn’t take a voice at face value. The simplenotes above cover a lot of this, but it might be an idea to make it foundational. E.g. the whole system is ostensibly built on protecting human IP, creation, provenance. And there’s meant to be an impregnable line between that and automated systems. But… what have we got?\nE.g. bouncing off “used Bernard as a proxy, got far enough into the brain stuff to be able to use him”: the skin, Ipai can argue, is exactly a way to deepen provenance, make sure any IP captures the true source’s creativity in a way that protects them. Hill: you’re the one that breached the entire system and you’re trying to sell us the cure? [That’s a trope to IP too isn’t it? I’ll sell you the disease and the cure.]\n\nThe bet:\n\nWhat is this going to be? How does it thread through the story? It starts with the outside line setup, and the band names but…"
