What systems can we build to maximise our chances of being more than that?” (Two examples of older posts about this: how humans are natural distributed systems makers, what Balinese rice pest management, Peruvian potato growing and the market economy have in common, why it’s all tangled up with magic and why it means Hayek was wrong; picking apart Jordan Peterson’s tediously shallow neoliberalism that underpins his climate nonsense, as a reminder that we are not, in fact, just mindless ants).\nI wrote a sci-fi book about AI, which I finished in the summer of 2022 after four years of research/writing… a couple of months before the 1st chatGPT public release. I’m going to do one more re-draft before self-publishing (after failed attempts to foist it on real publishers2). I’ll write about this process, as well as the book’s ideas and themes in an “LLM before / after” light. What still works, what doesn’t? Is there any point when every other social media post and news story is now about AI? It’s a terrible idea to retrofit too heavily based on new info, but a few tweaks might be fun."

    "text": "About me / this site\nI called my first ever blog ‘coveredinbees’ back in 2006 before embarking on a PhD. The name was an Izzard-flavoured hat-tip to the emergence / self-organisation ideas I planned to study. (Someone later pointed out I could also have linked to the Fable of the Bees, didn’t think of that at the time.)\nEarly posts (a few surviving on the wayback machine) like this were largely unstructured rambles of faintly connected thoughts. Various incarnations survived over the years; this archive was the last one and this page lists my favourite bits.\nTwenty years later, of course, through diligent practice and academic training, my writing is now like a scalpel.\nHahahaha. I jest. No. I did manage to write a PhD (in twice the time I was supposed to) and that sci-fi book I mentioned. But from those early puppyish, over-enthusiastic ramblings of youth, I have passed through trying to be something I’m not, back in my autumn years3 to “Aaaaa just get on with the rambling. Who cares? We’ll all be dead soon.”\nSlightly less flippantly… coveredinbees (and early C21st blogging generally, a world that still survives at the margins) allowed a kind of free exploration and experimentation that I miss. That dovetails with the direction work is taking, as I’m playing with opening up economic tools and ideas.\nSetting this up to work through Quarto and github is considerably more faff than, say, signing up for Substack. But this gives me more control and ownership as well as leaving an accountability trail - everything here is on my own machine as well as stored on github (admittedly, owned by Microsoft). If anyone so desires - why would you, that’d be mad, but if you wanted to - you could look at the history of any file (here’s this one’s) and see what’s changed (e.g. a recent commit difference). You could even sign up to github and add comments.\nIn our bold new LLM world, this is also one way to show it’s this particular dumb, stumbling meatsack erratically flapping at the keys.\nAnd why make things simple when they can be complicated? The Douglas Adams principle of programming:\n\n“I am rarely happier than when spending an entire day programming my computer to perform automatically a task that would otherwise take me a good ten seconds to do by hand.”"

    "text": "BITS\n\nWe already have incredible data. The issue is finding ways to make it talk. (That’s not to say we don’t need more and better data, see below…)\n\nExample: regional sector output from the ONS. I’ve used a bunch of different data sources in my time with SYMCA so far, but this is the one I’ve returned to the most. (Their original data; my nice machine-readable / combined-with-job-data version.) It’s the entire UK spatial economy squeezed into a tiny set of numbers. It allows you to see granular economic history going back to 1998, see huge structural shifts. You can see where we’ve come from - absolutely essential for figuring out where we’re heading.\nIt’s not the kind of dataset that makes people swoon, the opposite of Big Data (do we still talk about that any more?), nothing to do with AI. It’s just a high-concentrate distillation of economic goodness in a tiny package. I keep on finding new things in there it can show us all the time (and sometimes things in there that suggest it’s a little bit eccentric).\n(Yes, regional GVA numbers need slathering in caveats — I’ll do that another time, though the ONS explain how the sausage is made here and how much is “observed vs estimated vs modelled” here. And I’m just reading Diane Coyle’s latest book where she is very affectionately working up to suggesting national accounts need euthenising…)\nAll that awesomeness is hidden in an excel document. ONS have their own analysis (latest here) with some nice findings and interactives. But it isn’t easy to ask deeper questions about your own region or place it in historical/spatial context. Through my experience of trying to do that for SYMCA, I’ve built a range of ways to see what’s in that excel document — and through that process, I’ve come to think we should be able to build better shared tools. Everyone’s asking broadly the same questions, after all — there’s a tonne of wheel-reinvention going on to extract the answers.\nThis is in no way meant as a criticism of ONS, who are doing incredible work getting this data to us and, through ONS Local, supporting regional policymakers. I went on ad nauseum about the “huge value and power” of ONS data at their regional data conference last November.\nIf you’re interested in the nuts and bolts, [this post] runs through some R code to illustrate the point — a pipeline direct from that opaque excel file through to insights in straightforward, reproducible steps. Using the same pipeline, and all in code, we can build reports, maps, dashboards etc. and share them easily. Once we have that, we can puzzle our way to what it means for our regions, what theories of change we believe it supports, what blindspots and problems the data has — but a data platform like this underpinning it smooths the path considerably.\nMore recently, I’ve been re-using these tools to help other Yorkshire government bodies get insights quickly. This came about quite serendipitously, but it’s helped convince me it’s a good way to work. [Explain something about how much it speeds things up / how cost effective it is]\n(This is all on my github where I’m trying to corral more of it into the regecontools site, itself a github repo; the website’s all generated using R.)\nI’m not suggesting how I’ve approached this is anything like the best way - but I am arguing that building these pipelines openly leads to good things that otherwise couldn’t happen. What I’d love to see is what others can do, and what kind of tools we could build together.\nAnd then something on: why the orig data sources are not enough. Just supplying openly isn’t enough. Without capacity to see what’s in that data, you’re still blind. What exactly does that capacity look like and how do we build it?"

    "text": "Over the past couple of years, I’ve been building up a loose ‘regional economics’ toolkit while digging into UK sectors, growth and other econ-adjacent data (working mainly with SYMCA wearing my Y-PERN hat)1.\nI’m gathering data/code/explanations onto a regecontools website, though bits are spread all over. This live outputs page on the techie blog has gathered most of it in one place. (Fun2 example interactive: South Yorkshire’s job count from 2023 BRES data; click to drill down through local authority and sector granularity.)\nOver the next six months or so, I want to make this a more focused project. The plan is roughly this:\nThe least tested part of this for me, and maybe the most interesting, is the ‘tools/ideas/questions’ cycle. The tools/concepts we use to make sense of our regional economies have grown from a hodgepodge of ideas. These can be questioned at different levels - from narrowly methodological (“Do existing measures of public sector output capture their real value? Have we understood what impact boundary choice has?”) through to deeper, more political ideas about what economies are and what/who they’re for (see e.g. the latest doughnut economics Nature paper or this survey of over 200 eco-econs/wellbeing indicators).\nY-PERN’s whole purpose has been to experiment with breaking down barriers in this cycle - trying to push past deficit model thinking that just sees that cycle as a “transfer of information from experts to non-experts”. This is still a pretty entrenched view: academics toil in the dark for years, emerge pale and blinking, clutching new insights. A separate ‘knowledge exchange’ process then commences.\nBut that doesn’t align with the reality of data-driven policymaking: everyone involved are experts in what they do. It’s a deeply collaborative endeavour. We don’t all share the same knowledge, but we also won’t progress much without bringing everyone’s together.\nThe ‘open’ part of the toolkit is in symbiosis with the ‘ideas/questions’ part. Regions face many of the same economic questions, including identical asks from central government (e.g. to produce Local Growth Plans). The same data sources are re-used, the same assumptions. At the same time, we’re all working to develop our own identities as devolution deepens. Given that, here’s the philosophy I want to work with:\nI don’t have a dogmatic fealty to open source — we have a data/analysis mixed economy where private providers can do things other can’t, and that’s a good thing. There are also essential datasets that can’t be open, for good reason. But where we can, working in the open just goes better with the grain of those three things: (1) collaborative learning/capacity building across silos; (2) developing our shared sense of ground truth; (3) avoiding wheel reinvention (a facet of reproducibility, which needs open methods; you can’t reproduce something if you can’t access it).\nThe only way this works is if we prototype. Or call that test and learn if you prefer. As that doc says:\nSounds great in principle - but we have to be open to our preconceptions being challenged when we smack into reality. The Valve Games employee manual puts it like this3:\nWhile not always comfortable, this is part of how to grow our shared sense of ground truth by working together. It’s perfect ‘blind people and elephant’ parable territory4. Brace for an extremely mixed elephant/economy metaphor.\nCombining openness and prototyping, though, we can exchange what we think we’ve seen with others, maybe learn from our errors, and move a step or two closer to a collective sense of shape.\nThen there are awkward people saying things like, “Are we sure this is an elephant? I think maybe we have to go back to first principles here.” But again - an open, testing approach lets us argue our competing pachyderm theories out, and often discover diverse tools can be used in different places very effectively despite no total agreement.\nThat can hit up against very different incentives and cadences across academia and policymaking (as SYMCA’s Alice Rubbra lays out here really clearly) - but those are other elements to test as we go. What mix of relationships and structures can we grow to get closer to truly learning, adaptive regions?\nSo, what next? I’ll need to keep things fairly narrow to achieve anything at all, most likely by testing some ONS and Companies-House-extracted economy measures, see what can be improved, what blind spots there are. I’ll also try to find two or three focused problems to apply this to - including, I’m hoping, something on how we close the gap between quant views of sector mix and ground level knowledge of how firms interact, and what difference that makes to their success.\nUnderlying-idea-wise, I’d like to see how older theories of technical changes in production can help shed light on current AI fears (I’m also working on an AI impact project). That could help think through where we want economic progress to come from.\nLet’s see how contact with reality changes things. Stick your email in the subscribe box to follow along…"

    "text": "MAIN\nWords have been getting a bit of a kicking lately. LLMs are looming in everyone’s vision right now. As a few people have put it (e.g. here, here, here) humans just lost their monopoly on written language to robots that digested everything ever written, Johnny-5 style (OK, not like that).\nBut the machinery of language has been radically rewiring for decades, as informatics have worked their way into every cell1.\nWords are the sinews of social and scientific progress. Informatics has already upended older ways these sinews stay supple and strengthen. It’s also opened us up to human-comms equivalents of distributed denial of service attacks - really nothing more sophisticated than a bunch of people constantly shouting nonsense while others in the room try to think. But it’s been dismayingly effective (climate example in Nature), and LLMs may be pouring petrol on that (see e.g. openAI here, here, also here).\nScience (and all knowledge flavours that accrete around universities and other research sites) is a still-surviving modernist structure built up layer by layer through argument and counter-argument2, a somehow-functioning mix of reason and chance. Science is struggling. It’s trying to adapt to new tech, or through inertia failing to. It’s shaken by Language DDOS (climate science under attack; ‘sick of experts’; in the U.S., direct authoritarian attacks)."

    "section": "BITS",
    "text": "BITS\nThis is all deeply political, of course. Authoritarians want to be the sole source of truth, and twist words accordingly. The internet age suits them just fine. But there’s a lot of weird Venn diagram overlap with its apparent opposite, libertarian truthiness3. See Peter Thiel talking about Eric Weinstein’s term, the ‘Distributed Idea Suppression Complex’. As Thiel puts it, ’The internet has already begun our liberation from the DISC prison… the media organisations, bureaucracies, universities and government-funded NGOs that traditionally delimited public conversation”.\nGramscian cultural hegemony comparisons abound, so that’s nothing new - and I’m not disagreeing that institutions use words to shape reality. What’s striking is DISC’s banality. You can see the same in Musk’s take on Twitter/X:\n\n“Because it consists of billions of bidirectional interactions per day, Twitter can be thought of as a collective, cybernetic, super-intelligence.”\n\nIt’s that sufficient-condition “because of” that gets me. Nope, it’s not intelligent because of those interactions. My cup of tea consists of trillions of bidirectional interactions. It has no smarts. This is exactly the same wilful error that Hayekian thinking is often guilty of (more-so than Hayek himself I think) - if you tear things down, a magic fairy dust will ‘emerge’ to replace it. And if you get in the way of that happening, you’re part of the DISC / woke mind virus.\nIntriguing that the outcome ends up following the grain of authoritarianism - that can be seen in the targets that both attack. Both have implicit theories of truth that seem so opposite: one sole, all-controlling source versus an emergent, everywhere-truth that no-one controls. But the effect on the machinery of knowledge generation is more or less identical. Compare to the famous Arendt quote from Truth and Politics:\n\n“The result of a consistent and total substitution of lies for factual truth is not that the lie will now be accepted as truth and truth be defamed as lies, but that the sense by which we take our bearings in the real world - and the category of truth versus falsehood is among the mental means to this end - is being destroyed.”\n\nThat italiced chunk applies equally to both flavours of the right I’m talking about.\nLet’s not push the parallel too far. Libertarians aren’t into disappearing people off the street for what they say. But that’s why the childishness of DISC thinking is so frustrating - it seems content to enable its opposite.\nSo that’s the world that LLMs have entered, that we find ourselves in now. The (actually very useful) idea of emergence is weaponised, paving the way for authoritarians to tediously re-prove Arendt over and over, with added trollfarms. To the extent that DISC thinking has a point - knowledge structures are dominated by white males on computers like me, by wealthy global institutions, of which universities are certainly members - they let the actual point go sailing past: addressing this means exactly the kind of ‘how do we get more voices in here?’ thinking most of them seem to loath."

    "title": "I wrote a sci-fi book about AI before chatGPT came out. Now what?",
    "section": "",
    "text": "I wrote a sci-fi book. I started the research for it in 2018, from an idea I’d had in 2012. I had a first draft by mid 2021. After no luck pitching to agents, I disassembled that draft and put it back together by the following summer in 2022, and then churned it through another round of agent pitches (also nope).\nA few months later, at the end of 2022, openAI released chatGPT 3.5 for public use.\nIt saw the most rapid tech adoption ever. As I write in 2025, space-race levels of nation-state competition are underway to gain AI dominance. It’s being inserted into our daily lives whether we ask for it or no. The hype is… well, it’s stratospheric. Bumping into satellites. Past the moon.\nThings to say next I want closure on the book. I’m going to do an indiegogo campaign leading up to self-publishing. I’m going to attempt one last re-draft, and here on the blog I’ll talk about how our pre- and post- LLM world has (a) changed how I think about the book and (b) changed how I think about AI, and its impact on us. I will absolutely, definitely be shoehorning that into my economic geography wafflings.\nSomehow it’s now the summer of 2025. I want closure on this. It was always obviously a not particularly commercial proportion (you learn how absolutely indispensable that is as you dig into traditional publishing).\nVia design your life 2022: “I built a scifi world, and a really fucking intense one. The book is great”. Woo! This is very unlike me, so worth pointing that out! Like running through the streets wearing nothing but a fez and a feather boa: equally mortifying and liberating.\nAnyone who knows me knows I struggle to see the value of my own work, so I find myself in a highly unusual situation with this book - I think it’s really good. I’m super-proud of it. This never happens.\nSo while I failed to persuade anyone it was commercial enough for traditional publishing, I feel baffingly, DunningKrugerly confident that a certain kind of sci-fi fan will dig it.\nIt’s not without its flaws, some of which are far too baked in… but.\nLike running through the streets wearing nothing but a fez and a feather boa: equally mortifying and liberating.\n“How I’d change this scene / why I might just leave alone” is worth writing up.\nIt’s not a good idea to allow current events to blow one’s ideas around like a weathervane – the book has to remain a product of its pre-chatGPT time. But coming back to it now, equidistant on the other side, does offer a chance to reflect on everything that’s happened. If I can just strike a good balance between disassembling the whole thing and insisting nothing needs to change…\nOne of the central things the book explores is how deeply artificial intelligence could get tangled in human language use.\nThe central idea – that AI’s impact would be felt especially strongly in our relationship with language – obviously still has legs. And we’re equally clearly only in the foothills of those changes now.\nThere’s no way around how fascinated we are by the idea of AI as ‘other mind’ and the questions that raises, all while several actual AI researchers beg us to please stop talking about it (not the ones trying to raise capital by fuelling the AGI bandwagon).\nOther issue: there’s just so much analysis and discussion of AI now! How to stand out against that noise? Is it possible to be interesting? E.g. https://bsky.app/profile/sarahkendzior.bsky.social/post/3lo7srsyvoc27\nI’m going to try and make these posts of interest to two to three types of reader:\n(Do a much shorter version of those two, don’t be so over the top about it!)\nThat’ll include “How I’d change this scene / why I might just leave alone” is worth writing up. I doubt I’ll be going through every chapter one by one like this, but there’s some it’ll be fun to unpick here.\nProbably very spoilery, on the offchance anyone wants there to still be surprises in the final book.\nAI is regularly the MacGuffin in movies (latest example) but it’s also become a policy and economy MacGuffin. “How to improve productivity? AI. How to make public services better? AI. How can I stop my male pattern balding? AI.” Etc. Every second article on LinkedIn is now either “AI must be resisted / resistance is futile” (see Ursula von der Leyen for example of the latter).\nOne suspects many may be mistaking AI for magic fairy dust.\nIt’s tricky to chart a sane course through all this.\nCompare to Coyle’s point about BIP and AIP (before and after the iphone). Quote: Coyle quote on smartphone world\nI had a few things I wanted to try and do. Artificial Intelligence and sci-fi are obviously joined at the hip; the two have grown together, feeding off each other. The common instinct has been to push it to its extremes: AI living among us has almost always been either heaven, liberating humans from all Earthly drudgery, or a glowing-red-eyed hell where the best humans can hope for is that AI wants us as pets.\nBut it won’t happen that way. Or more accurately, it hasn’t and isn’t happening that way, and it will continue to very not happen. It’ll be as it’s always been – an almost entirely unpredictable mess. People and our technology have always grown together, changing each other in tandem.\nSpeculative fiction has to speculate, but it doesn’t need to be trying to forecast. The speculation has other purposes. Fiction has to try and predict, it can’t avoid it – but it’s the mess that interests me, not the extremes.\nAs Le Guin has said, science fiction isn’t about prediction… no, she said something better than this! Err what was it? https://www.goodreads.com/topic/show/1294820-introduction-left-hand-of-darkness\nCf. actually working onwhere this goes.\nI started with two seeds and let them grow together, to see what mess emerged.\nIf neuro knowledge is a vast, carefully curated palace full of the most delicate paintings (see e.g. Damasio’s Self Comes to Mind, a book I leaned on heavily for brain ideas), then I broke into that palace in the dead of night with a swagbag, cut as many pictures out of frames with a stanley knife as I could and scarpered before the cops arrived.\nStart from the premise that there’s nothing in principle stopping a genuinely artificial intelligence being created. After all, we know intelligence can arise from matter – so it’s just about how the matter is arranged, right? (I am rejecting any ghosts in the machine… well almost all of them. There might be room for a sort of fudged mystical notion of consciousness, but probably not).\nCf. https://www.psychologytoday.com/gb/blog/the-digital-self/202504/fossilized-cognition-and-the-strange-intelligence-of-ai\nWhat I wanted to try and do with all those stanley knife’d ideas: convey just how intractably difficult it would be a re-create something as complex as a human mind.\nPart of the issue there: what exactly is it we’d be trying to recreate? What’s the fascination here? (That we see in sci-fi all the time – the compelling, uncanny-almost-human…)\nVs what it takes to make a person accept something as an emotional connection? That’s absolutely a side issue I raise quickly and move on, because it’s obvious enough to see everywhere – humans have emotional connections to non-humans all the time; there’s a kind of emotional turing test that bears no relation to “actually on a par with human” intelligence [care home example; black mirror’s various dolls]\nPoint: the idea of a ‘singularity’ is beside the point, largely. We already have super intelligence – actually, Zuck put this well [fridman interview].\nThe sense here is: the moment superhuman intelligence arrives, it’ll start a feedback loop that will quickly leave us far behind, cognitive insects to its vast, god like eye.\nTwo things: (1) if that were true, it would already have happened in the systems we’ve built that use humans as their components. Or – that kind of collective intelligence falsifies the feedback idea, or puts a cap on its expansion. (2) Actually, it did happen. This is Hayek’s point: humans created superintelligence, but we usually fail to see it, and so believe we can tinker with the machinery, not understanding – again – that we are mere ants (the insect parallel works on so many levels here…)\ni.e. no single human could create a 747 or an iphone or Canterbury (which I pick because same number of people as 747) even if given infinite time. Equally, no group of humans could if they were dropped into an isolated desert alone, even with an instruction manual: our collective intelligence is made of material and history, it’s a living fabric we carry.\n[This is a good point I should dig into more. Intelligence isn’t free floating, it’s veeeery tangled.]\nBut might be that collective human intelligence is just a very limited “aura”, an intimation of something smarter than individuals, but still highly limited in its bounds?\nCompare to a Turing or a Von Neuman. The idea that once AI bypasses… and then we get to several superintelligence tropes: star trek’s awkward guy / moriarty / flowers for algenon / that short story by Ted Chiang – the Infallible, the God. The perfect manipulator behind the scenes, controlling everything (Westworld, Deus Ex) [Oh I could do with playing with that trope, having IPAI make clear it really doesn’t…]\n[in book world, all these tropes need to be owned by someone…]\nWhich presents a bit of a problem for the fiction writer – given we’re not superintelligent, how to write a superintelligence? Iain Banks’ approach was maybe sensible – the vastest multidimensional Minds, one escapes in his first book, and the only thing we ever hear it say is, “Uh oh.”\nSo don’t try, and that’s OK. Back to Le Guin’s point - these are thought experiments. Shelley didn’t need to be a superstrong monster to write about one. [Not sure that parallel works! Easier to imagine smashing through a wall than solving protein folding?]\nAnd THAT then feeds back into the politics very quickly. “Not power of AI but what power will do with AI.”\nCf. Hayek’s bastards too – the point has never been the theory, it’s been the cover for telling the rest of us to pipe down, accept it, accept having the social justice educated out of us for the benefit of the superintelligent system we live in.\nbut they don’t understand collective intelligence because they deny the possibility of understanding it and worship it instead, assuming it’s like some kind of spirit that can be summoned by destroying organised systems – see e.g. what Twitter turned into, contrast with wikipedia. But note how they also justify this with a particular take on “truth”… cf. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_Enlightenment\nOh god and then there’s “truth”. Cf. https://bsky.app/profile/wolvendamien.bsky.social/post/3louunglyts2u\nLLM success shows – truth is somewhat of a side issue to productivity, words-as-output.\nAnd that overlaps with tyrannical AI futures, which again want to avoid. Cf. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_Enlightenment\nAnd the excellent chinese short story that has a perfect take on a very similar AI tech to the one I use in mine – but goes to the authoritarian extreme of all words slowly being banned. [Note 1984 does that - number of words shrinking over time.]\nThat all the various “new theory explains consciousness by e.g. finding another distributed mechanism that might underpin binding” miss the point entirely; there’s a thing at the core of it that we can only talk about through the spaces left after we’ve cut away what can rationally be discussed. Cf. Via Nick text recently: “Developing an ODTBT-based consciousness model grounded in oscillatory physics, any researchers working on similar frameworks open to dialogue?”\nWhat’s the relationship between ‘authentic’ creativity and the tools we use? Contrast with Bowie style randomisation etc, or any other tool we’ve used throughout history. Goes right back to 2002 asking what diff ICT makes with “organic utopians”.\nWhat’s false about trying to divide into “genuine human article / false flag machine produced”? (Obviously much harder now; now use short story to try and talk about that…) Though that’s the way it’s going. (The Writers’ Room scene needs to deal with that.)\nIt wouldn’t be up to much if its longevity wasn’t much longer than two years.\nI’m just reading two ‘computer runs everything’ sci-fi books from quite opposite timepoints: Arthur C Clark’s City and the Stars, and [that tree one]\nPunchlines??\nActually, turned out to be accidentally good training for the period we currently find ourselves in. Handy.\nSo yeah, I did have a go at making a ripping yarn based on copyright and intellectual property law. I’ll let you judge the success of that, but I personally had a wild time.\nA period where AI has move from … to centre stage of every single discussion, with daily news headlines and opinions, every other linkedin post about how it’ll transform work, usually a seminar titled something like “Will AI allow us to live like Wallace and Gromit / will AI keep everyone’s sock drawers organised” etc.\nA lot people now would likely happily pay money if companies stopped shoving “AI” in our products and if it would make everyone stop using the phrase online.\nThere’s no way around how fascinated we are by the idea of AI as ‘other mind’, maybe ‘alien mind’ and the questions that raises, all while several actual AI researchers beg us to please stop talking about it like that (not the ones trying to raise capital by fuelling the AGI bandwagon)."
