What systems can we build to maximise our chances of being more than that?” (Two examples of older posts about this: how humans are natural distributed systems makers, what Balinese rice pest management, Peruvian potato growing and the market economy have in common, why it’s all tangled up with magic and why it means Hayek was wrong; picking apart Jordan Peterson’s tediously shallow neoliberalism that underpins his climate nonsense, as a reminder that we are not, in fact, just mindless ants).\nI wrote a sci-fi book about AI, which I finished in the summer of 2022 after four years of research/writing… a couple of months before the 1st chatGPT public release. I’m going to do one more re-draft before self-publishing (after failed attempts to foist it on real publishers2). I’ll write about this process, as well as the book’s ideas and themes in an “LLM before / after” light. What still works, what doesn’t? Is there any point when every other social media post and news story is now about AI? It’s a terrible idea to retrofit too heavily based on new info, but a few tweaks might be fun."

    "text": "About me / this site\nI called my first ever blog ‘coveredinbees’ back in 2006 before embarking on a PhD. The name was an Izzard-flavoured hat-tip to the emergence / self-organisation ideas I planned to study. (Someone later pointed out I could also have linked to the Fable of the Bees, didn’t think of that at the time.)\nEarly posts (a few surviving on the wayback machine) like this were largely unstructured rambles of faintly connected thoughts. Various incarnations survived over the years; this archive was the last one and this page lists my favourite bits.\nTwenty years later, of course, through diligent practice and academic training, my writing is now like a scalpel.\nHahahaha. I jest. No. I did manage to write a PhD (in twice the time I was supposed to) and a sci-fi book (more on that soon). But from those early puppyish, over-enthusiastic ramblings of youth, I have passed through trying to be something I’m not, back in my autumn years3 to “Aaaaa just get on with the rambling. Who cares? We’ll all be dead soon.”\nSlightly less flippantly… coveredinbees (and early C21st blogging generally, a world that still survives at the margins) allowed a kind of free exploration and experimentation that I miss. That dovetails with the direction work is taking, as I’m playing with opening up economic tools and ideas. That site leans heavily towards the narrow how-to stuff - I want to open that up, connect to the “so what” and arguments around things like how we measure, how we connect ideas and values through to our tools.\nSetting this up to work through Quarto and github is considerably more faff than, say, signing up for Substack. But this gives me more control and ownership as well as leaving an accountability trail - everything here is on my own machine as well as stored on github (admittedly, owned by Microsoft). If anyone so desires - why would you, that’d be mad, but if you wanted to - you could look at the history of any file (here’s this one’s) and see what’s changed (e.g. a recent commit difference). You could even sign up to github and add comments.\nIn our bold new LLM world, this is also one way to show it’s this particular dumb, stumbling meatsack awkwardly flapping the words out.\nAnd why make things simple when they can be complicated? The Douglas Adams principle of programming:\n\n“I am rarely happier than when spending an entire day programming my computer to perform automatically a task that would otherwise take me a good ten seconds to do by hand.”"

    "text": "MAIN\nWords have been getting a bit of a kicking lately. LLMs are looming in everyone’s vision right now. As a few people have put it (e.g. here, here, here) humans just lost their monopoly on written language to robots that digested everything ever written, Johnny-5 style (OK, not like that).\nBut the machinery of language has been radically rewiring for decades, as informatics have worked their way into every cell1.\nWords are the sinews of social and scientific progress. Informatics has already upended older ways these sinews stay supple and strengthen. It’s also opened us up to human-comms equivalents of distributed denial of service attacks - really nothing more sophisticated than a bunch of people constantly shouting nonsense while others in the room try to think. But it’s been dismayingly effective (climate example in Nature), and LLMs may be pouring petrol on that (see e.g. openAI here, here, also here).\nScience (and all knowledge flavours that accrete around universities and other research sites) is a still-surviving modernist structure built up layer by layer through argument and counter-argument2, a somehow-functioning mix of reason and chance. Science is struggling. It’s trying to adapt to new tech, or through inertia failing to. It’s shaken by Language DDOS (climate science under attack; ‘sick of experts’; in the U.S., direct authoritarian attacks)."

    "section": "BITS",
    "text": "BITS\nThis is all deeply political, of course. Authoritarians want to be the sole source of truth, and twist words accordingly. The internet age suits them just fine. But there’s a lot of weird Venn diagram overlap with its apparent opposite, libertarian truthiness3. See Peter Thiel talking about Eric Weinstein’s term, the ‘Distributed Idea Suppression Complex’. As Thiel puts it, ’The internet has already begun our liberation from the DISC prison… the media organisations, bureaucracies, universities and government-funded NGOs that traditionally delimited public conversation”.\nGramscian cultural hegemony comparisons abound, so that’s nothing new - and I’m not disagreeing that institutions use words to shape reality. What’s striking is DISC’s banality. You can see the same in Musk’s take on Twitter/X:\n\n“Because it consists of billions of bidirectional interactions per day, Twitter can be thought of as a collective, cybernetic, super-intelligence.”\n\nIt’s that sufficient-condition “because of” that gets me. Nope, it’s not intelligent because of those interactions. My cup of tea consists of trillions of bidirectional interactions. It has no smarts. This is exactly the same wilful error that Hayekian thinking is often guilty of (more-so than Hayek himself I think) - if you tear things down, a magic fairy dust will ‘emerge’ to replace it. And if you get in the way of that happening, you’re part of the DISC / woke mind virus.\nIntriguing that the outcome ends up following the grain of authoritarianism - that can be seen in the targets that both attack. Both have implicit theories of truth that seem so opposite: one sole, all-controlling source versus an emergent, everywhere-truth that no-one controls. But the effect on the machinery of knowledge generation is more or less identical. Compare to the famous Arendt quote from Truth and Politics:\n\n“The result of a consistent and total substitution of lies for factual truth is not that the lie will now be accepted as truth and truth be defamed as lies, but that the sense by which we take our bearings in the real world - and the category of truth versus falsehood is among the mental means to this end - is being destroyed.”\n\nThat italiced chunk applies equally to both flavours of the right I’m talking about.\nLet’s not push the parallel too far. Libertarians aren’t into disappearing people off the street for what they say. But that’s why the childishness of DISC thinking is so frustrating - it seems content to enable its opposite.\nSo that’s the world that LLMs have entered, that we find ourselves in now. The (actually very useful) idea of emergence is weaponised, paving the way for authoritarians to tediously re-prove Arendt over and over, with added trollfarms. To the extent that DISC thinking has a point - knowledge structures are dominated by white males on computers like me, by wealthy global institutions, of which universities are certainly members - they let the actual point go sailing past: addressing this means exactly the kind of ‘how do we get more voices in here?’ thinking most of them seem to loath."

    "text": "Over the past couple of years, I’ve been building up a loose ‘regional economics’ toolkit while digging into UK sectors, growth and other data (working mainly with SYMCA wearing my Y-PERN hat)1.\nOver the next six months or so, I want to try and make this a more focused project. The plan is roughly this:\nData/code/explanations are slowly being gathered into a regecontools website, though bits are spread all over (this live outputs page on the techie blog has gathered most of it in one place). By building pipelines like this, we can speed up reports, maps, dashboards etc, and share them easily (that last link collects a bunch of these in one place).\nThe least tested part of this for me, and maybe the most interesting, is the ‘tools/ideas/questions’ cycle. The tools/concepts we use to make sense of our regional economies have grown from a hodgepodge of ideas. These can be questioned at different levels - from narrowly methodological (“how much difference does it make to productivity if we exclude imputed rent? Do existing measures of public sector output capture their real value?”) to deeper, more political ideas about what economies are and what/who they’re for (see e.g. the latest doughnut econs Nature paper or this survey of over 200 eco-econs/wellbeing indicators).\nY-PERN’s whole purpose has been to experiment with breaking down barriers in this cycle - trying to push past deficit model thinking that just sees the cycle as a “transfer of information from experts to non-experts”. This is still a pretty entrenched view: academics toil in the dark for years, emerge pale and blinking, clutching new insights. A separate ‘knowledge exchange’ process then occurs.\nBut that doesn’t align with the reality of data-driven policymaking: everyone involved are experts in what they do. It’s a deeply collaborative endeavour. We don’t all share the same knowledge, but we also won’t progress much without bringing everyone’s together.\nThe ‘open’ part of the toolkit is in symbiosis with the ‘ideas/questions’ part. Regions face many of the same economic questions, including identical asks from central government (e.g. to produce Local Growth Plans). The same data sources are re-used, the same assumptions. At the same time, we’re all working to develop our own identities as devolution deepens. Given that -\nI don’t have a dogmatic fealty to open source — we need a data/analysis mixed economy where private providers can do things other can’t. There are also essential datasets that can’t be open, for good reason. But where we can, working in the open just goes better with the grain of those three things: (1) collaborative learning/capacity building across silos; (2) developing our shared sense of ground truth; (3) avoiding wheel reinvention (a facet of reproducibility, which needs open methods; you can’t reproduce something if you can’t access it).\nThe only way this works is if we prototype. Or call that test and learn if you prefer. As that doc says:\nSounds great in principle - but we have to be open to preconceptions being challenged when we smack into reality. The Valve Games employee manual2 puts it like this:\nWhile not always comfortable, this is part of how to grow our shared sense of ground truth. It’s perfect ‘blind people and elephant’ parable territory3. Brace for an extremely mixed elephant/economy metaphor.\nCombining openness and prototyping, though, we can exchange what we think we’ve seen with others, maybe learn from our errors, and move a step or two closer to a collective sense of the shape.\nThen there are awkward people saying things like, “Are we sure this is an elephant? I think maybe we have to go back to first principles here.” But again - an open, testing approach lets us argue our competing pachiderm theories out, and often discover diverse tools can be used in different places very effectively despite no total agreement.\nComing back to the aims - these will necessarily have to be fairly narrow to achieve anything at all. I’ll most likely start by testing some different basic ONS and Companies house economy measures, see what could be improved, what blind spots are. I’ll also try to find two or three focused problems to apply this to - including, I’m hoping, something on how we close the gap between quant views of sector mix and ground level knowledge of how firms interact and what difference that makes to their success.\nLet’s see how contact with reality changes things…"

It’s a good time to try\nbecause of the networks because of being able to create space for it Start with some humility - the world doesn’t have a shortage of people who’ll be willing to tell you they know The Answers.\nBlack box vs network [can mention some of the hollowing-out issues here that have no quick fix cf. Bradford community data]\nWhat I think we have a chance to do collectively is a bit different - to create a shared sense of ground truth as we work together, built on the best understanding we can create between us.\n(Also, these last two points are rarely so cleanly separated - back to that in a moment.)\nIssues around avoiding data-driven questions, streetlight effect. Issue of developing our own internal model - not just infographic cf. x-ray What are we missing? What’s wrong with our data and methods?\nThe limitations here include: “you need to leave the house and talk to people.” This is the quant data / reality gap…\nThen, somewhere in here: what do we want? That’s the normative stuff. Try to unpick examples here. E.g. assumptions around how to make everyone more wealthy are key there, right?\nBut open methods are more aligned with what I think is the reality of data-driven policymaking: everyone involved are experts in what they do. This is a deeply collaborative endeavour. We don’t all have the same knowledge, but we also won’t progress much without bringing everyone’s together. Contrast to the deficit model, which imagines a “transfer of information from experts to non-experts”. (This is a fairly common view of e.g. the university / policy relationship.)\nSometimes there’s straightforward transmission - if I’m teaching R coding methods to people who are new to it, say. But it’s never just that. I’ve seen this again and again in different settings - here, we bought some data skills but had little insight into what that Sheffield homelessness charity’s data actually meant. They made it make sense.\nIn regional policy, it’s been a little different but with the same outcome.\nTwo things, the above then also capacity building / why open methods = learning/collab = capacity building (I think)\nYou probably wouldn’t want collaborative heart surgery for example\nBecause it’s open, anyone can contribute, copy, re-use etc\nSo the more we build relationships and share tools and ideas, the better. Y-PERN’s helped grow the strength of those relationships in Yorkshire & Humber\nA lot of that groundwork has been done already through regional network building. We have a decent chance of getting a handle on a good two-thirds to three-quarters of the pachiderm.\nThe status of those last question types is tricky. As SYMCA’s Alice Rubbra eloquently explains here on the Y-PERN blog, it’s a clash of wotsits\nRemain tool agnostic, code, no-code. I’m an R person, others won’t be, and there are up and downsides to going that route. Thinking agnostically, I can still provide links to processed data sources that others can use, and provide easy-ish-to-run examples…\nI’ve already seen the value of openness for my own process of getting from numbers to things-in-front-of-policymakers [frame better?]. But how to deepen the collaboration part?\nThe ‘shared ground truth’ thing has a couple of elements. I’ve heard more than once about data ‘black boxes’ that can result from some commissioned work. You get an analysis, but no access to the data and no way to really know how conclusions have been reached. It’s a one-time hit - once the commission’s done, you decide to either take the results on face value or not, and then have to re-commission if more is needed later. [ties to point above about this not being a purely client rel - about that ‘shared truth’ thing between us where data is one facet… oh I do say this below!]\nAgain — I’m not saying that can’t be valuable and necessary, as organisations can supply expert analyses that often can’t be done in-house. I also carry out that kind of interpretation.\nBuild on open data, make the tools, build the capacity, link people together, do it questioningly, allow ways to get to the root and feed that back into the policy cycle, “walk asking”.\nThere are reasons why data work can’t be done openly (datasets that contain private information) or won’t be done openly (data/methods are IP a firm earns its living from; researchers protecting a lovingly curated dataset). But in regional policy, and with the vast body of data the ONS among others hold, there’s plenty of scope for it.\nThis is in GVA post and should connect:\nAnd then something on: why the orig data sources are not enough. Just supplying openly isn’t enough. Without capacity to see what’s in that data, you’re still blind. What exactly does that capacity look like and how do we build it?\nMore recently, I’ve been re-using these tools to help other Yorkshire government bodies get insights quickly. This came about quite serendipitously, but it’s helped convince me it’s a good way to work. [Explain something about how much it speeds things up / how cost effective it is]\n(This is all on my github where I’m trying to corral more of it into the regionalecontools site, itself a github repo; the website’s all generated using R.)\nI’m not suggesting how I’ve approached this is anything like the best way - but I am arguing that building these pipelines openly leads to good things that otherwise couldn’t happen. What I’d love to see is what others can do, and what kind of tools we could build together.\nI will now proceed to go on about this at length, starting with a mildly trite statement that I’ll then unpick."
