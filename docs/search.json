Here’s what ‘economic / spatial / political’ covers, roughly: “Where everything human comes together and crashes into everything else. All our loves, hopes, poverty, riches, work, community, loneliness, travel, arguments, divisions, pot hole incidents. We live in the middle of this mess, and it works bafflingly well, though it’s riddled with dysfunction. Do we know why it works? When things break, do we know why it stopped working? Do we know enough to make plans, to have ambitions and dreams, to change things, to know when to leave alone? Who gets to decide what changes?”\nMixed in with bonus random topics (my other writing is a good guide), there’ll be posts asking, “Are we more than just mindless ants? What systems can we build to maximise our chances of being more than that?” (Two examples of older posts about this: how humans are natural distributed systems makers, what Balinese rice pest management, Peruvian potato growing and the market economy have in common, why it’s all tangled up with magic and why it means Hayek was wrong; picking apart Jordan Peterson’s tediously shallow neoliberalism that underpins his climate nonsense, as a reminder that we are not, in fact, just mindless ants).\nI wrote a sci-fi book about AI, which I finished in the summer of 2022 after four years of research/writing… a couple of months before the 1st chatGPT public release. I’m going to do one more re-draft before self-publishing (after failed attempts to foist it on real publishers2). I’ll write about this process, as well as the book’s ideas and themes in an “LLM before / after” light. What still works, what doesn’t? Is there any point when every other social media post and news story is now about AI? It’s a terrible idea to retrofit too heavily based on new info, but a few tweaks might be fun."

The name was an Izzard-flavoured hat-tip to the emergence / self-organisation ideas I planned to study. (Someone later pointed out I could also have linked to the Fable of the Bees, didn’t think of that at the time.)\nEarly posts (a few surviving on the wayback machine) like this were largely unstructured rambles of faintly connected thoughts. Various incarnations survived over the years; this archive was the last one and this page lists my favourite bits.\nTwenty years later, of course, through diligent practice and academic training, my writing is now like a scalpel.\nHahahaha. I jest. No. I did manage to write a PhD (in twice the time I was supposed to) and that sci-fi book I mentioned. But from those early puppyish, over-enthusiastic ramblings of youth, I have passed through trying to be something I’m not, back in my autumn years3 to “Aaaaa just get on with the rambling. Who cares? We’ll all be dead soon.”\nSlightly less flippantly… coveredinbees (and early C21st blogging generally, a world that still survives at the margins) allowed a kind of free exploration and experimentation that I miss. That dovetails with the direction work is taking, as I’m playing with opening up economic tools and ideas.\nSetting this up to work through Quarto and github is considerably more faff than, say, signing up for Substack. But this gives me more control and ownership as well as leaving an accountability trail - everything here is on my own machine as well as stored on github (admittedly, owned by Microsoft). If anyone so desires - why would you, that’d be mad, but if you wanted to - you could look at the history of any file (here’s this one’s) and see what’s changed (e.g. a recent commit difference). You could even sign up to github and add comments.\nIn our bold new LLM world, this is also one way to show it’s this particular dumb, stumbling meatsack erratically flapping at the keys.\nAnd why make things simple when they can be complicated? The Douglas Adams principle of programming:\n\n“I am rarely happier than when spending an entire day programming my computer to perform automatically a task that would otherwise take me a good ten seconds to do by hand.”"

As a few people have put it (e.g. here, here, here) humans just lost their monopoly on written language to robots that digested everything ever written, Johnny-5 style (OK, not like that).\nBut the machinery of language has been radically rewiring for decades, as informatics have worked their way into every cell1.\nWords are the sinews of social and scientific progress. Informatics has already upended older ways these sinews stay supple and strengthen. It’s also opened us up to human-comms equivalents of distributed denial of service attacks - really nothing more sophisticated than a bunch of people constantly shouting nonsense while others in the room try to think. But it’s been dismayingly effective (climate example in Nature), and LLMs may be pouring petrol on that (see e.g. openAI here, here, also here).\nScience (and all knowledge flavours that accrete around universities and other research sites) is a still-surviving modernist structure built up layer by layer through argument and counter-argument2, a somehow-functioning mix of reason and chance. Science is struggling. It’s trying to adapt to new tech, or through inertia failing to. It’s shaken by Language DDOS (climate science under attack; ‘sick of experts’; in the U.S., direct authoritarian attacks)."

    "text": "BITS\nThis is all deeply political, of course. Authoritarians want to be the sole source of truth, and twist words accordingly. The internet age suits them just fine. But there’s a lot of weird Venn diagram overlap with its apparent opposite, libertarian truthiness3. See Peter Thiel talking about Eric Weinstein’s term, the ‘Distributed Idea Suppression Complex’. As Thiel puts it, ’The internet has already begun our liberation from the DISC prison… the media organisations, bureaucracies, universities and government-funded NGOs that traditionally delimited public conversation”.\nGramscian cultural hegemony comparisons abound, so that’s nothing new - and I’m not disagreeing that institutions use words to shape reality. What’s striking is DISC’s banality. You can see the same in Musk’s take on Twitter/X:\n\n“Because it consists of billions of bidirectional interactions per day, Twitter can be thought of as a collective, cybernetic, super-intelligence.”\n\nIt’s that sufficient-condition “because of” that gets me. Nope, it’s not intelligent because of those interactions. My cup of tea consists of trillions of bidirectional interactions. It has no smarts. This is exactly the same wilful error that Hayekian thinking is often guilty of (more-so than Hayek himself I think) - if you tear things down, a magic fairy dust will ‘emerge’ to replace it. And if you get in the way of that happening, you’re part of the DISC / woke mind virus.\nIntriguing that the outcome ends up following the grain of authoritarianism - that can be seen in the targets that both attack. Both have implicit theories of truth that seem so opposite: one sole, all-controlling source versus an emergent, everywhere-truth that no-one controls. But the effect on the machinery of knowledge generation is more or less identical. Compare to the famous Arendt quote from Truth and Politics:\n\n“The result of a consistent and total substitution of lies for factual truth is not that the lie will now be accepted as truth and truth be defamed as lies, but that the sense by which we take our bearings in the real world - and the category of truth versus falsehood is among the mental means to this end - is being destroyed.”\n\nThat italiced chunk applies equally to both flavours of the right I’m talking about.\nLet’s not push the parallel too far. Libertarians aren’t into disappearing people off the street for what they say. But that’s why the childishness of DISC thinking is so frustrating - it seems content to enable its opposite.\nSo that’s the world that LLMs have entered, that we find ourselves in now. The (actually very useful) idea of emergence is weaponised, paving the way for authoritarians to tediously re-prove Arendt over and over, with added trollfarms. To the extent that DISC thinking has a point - knowledge structures are dominated by white males on computers like me, by wealthy global institutions, of which universities are certainly members - they let the actual point go sailing past: addressing this means exactly the kind of ‘how do we get more voices in here?’ thinking most of them seem to loath."

    "text": "BITS\n\nWe already have incredible data. The issue is finding ways to make it talk. (That’s not to say we don’t need more and better data, see below…)\n\nExample: regional sector output from the ONS. I’ve used a bunch of different data sources in my time with SYMCA so far, but this is the one I’ve returned to the most. (Their original data; my nice machine-readable / combined-with-job-data version.) It’s the entire UK spatial economy squeezed into a tiny set of numbers. It allows you to see granular economic history going back to 1998, see huge structural shifts. You can see where we’ve come from - absolutely essential for figuring out where we’re heading.\nIt’s not the kind of dataset that makes people swoon, the opposite of Big Data (do we still talk about that any more?), nothing to do with AI. It’s just a high-concentrate distillation of economic goodness in a tiny package. I keep on finding new things in there it can show us all the time (and sometimes things in there that suggest it’s a little bit eccentric).\n(Yes, regional GVA numbers need slathering in caveats — I’ll do that another time, though the ONS explain how the sausage is made here and how much is “observed vs estimated vs modelled” here. And I’m just reading Diane Coyle’s latest book where she is very affectionately working up to suggesting national accounts need euthenising…)\nAll that awesomeness is hidden in an excel document. ONS have their own analysis (latest here) with some nice findings and interactives. But it isn’t easy to ask deeper questions about your own region or place it in historical/spatial context. Through my experience of trying to do that for SYMCA, I’ve built a range of ways to see what’s in that excel document — and through that process, I’ve come to think we should be able to build better shared tools. Everyone’s asking broadly the same questions, after all — there’s a tonne of wheel-reinvention going on to extract the answers.\nThis is in no way meant as a criticism of ONS, who are doing incredible work getting this data to us and, through ONS Local, supporting regional policymakers. I went on ad nauseum about the “huge value and power” of ONS data at their regional data conference last November.\nIf you’re interested in the nuts and bolts, [this post] runs through some R code to illustrate the point — a pipeline direct from that opaque excel file through to insights in straightforward, reproducible steps. Using the same pipeline, and all in code, we can build reports, maps, dashboards etc. and share them easily. Once we have that, we can puzzle our way to what it means for our regions, what theories of change we believe it supports, what blindspots and problems the data has — but a data platform like this underpinning it smooths the path considerably.\nMore recently, I’ve been re-using these tools to help other Yorkshire government bodies get insights quickly. This came about quite serendipitously, but it’s helped convince me it’s a good way to work. [Explain something about how much it speeds things up / how cost effective it is]\n(This is all on my github where I’m trying to corral more of it into the regecontools site, itself a github repo; the website’s all generated using R.)\nI’m not suggesting how I’ve approached this is anything like the best way - but I am arguing that building these pipelines openly leads to good things that otherwise couldn’t happen. What I’d love to see is what others can do, and what kind of tools we could build together.\nAnd then something on: why the orig data sources are not enough. Just supplying openly isn’t enough. Without capacity to see what’s in that data, you’re still blind. What exactly does that capacity look like and how do we build it?"

    "text": "I wrote a sci-fi book about artificial intelligence. I started the research for it in 2018, from an idea I’d had in 2012. A first draft was done by mid 2021. After no luck pitching to agents, I lovingly disassembled that draft and put it back together by the following summer in 2022, then churned through another round of agent pitches (also nope).\nA few months later, at the end of 2022, openAI released chatGPT 3.5 for public use. Three years have since passed. That Oatmeal panel above (from this piece) is how a lot of people feel now about AI - there’s a decent chance you’d be willing to pay to make everyone please shut up about it, please stop inserting it into our lives whether we ask for it or no.\nAmid this ceaseless cacophony, I am planning to get the book out into the world. Great timing. I’ve set myself this aim:\nI’ll be re-assessing the book scene by scene in this final loop, writing about the ideas and the construction of it. It has to remain a product of its pre-chatGPT time. It’s a bad idea to let current events blow one’s ideas around like a weathervane. But our brave new LLM world (bubble pop or not) does offer a chance to reflect. How much has it (a) changed how I think about the book and (b) changed how I think about AI and its impact on us?\nAnyone who knows me knows I struggle to see the value of my own work. The book has plenty of flaws, but I’m super-proud of it. This never happens. I feel baffingly, DunningKrugerly confident in it. I’ve worked hard to mix ideas with pace, to write something fun. Your definition of fun may differ, but I think a certain kind of sci-fi fan (i.e. people like me) will dig it. I’m going to roll with that feeling before my brain notices.\nSo stick your email in the subscribe box if…\n(I’ll mark sci-fi related posts, in case you want to avoid other stuff I write about.)\nIn my day-job, I’m now working on analysis of AI workplace impacts. Given that, writing about sci-fi feels a bit like running through town wearing nothing but a fez and a feather boa: equally mortifying and liberating, potentially illegal. But it’s how I was schooled - in the last year of my Sheffield politics degree, Mike Kenny paired social theory with sci-fi every week2. I was introduced there to what’s arguably still my favourite book, Le Guin’s Dispossessed. (We didn’t have to wear just a fez and feather boa in seminars though.) Causal arrows between our imaginations and reality go in all directions (though that has issues - see below)."

    "text": "In my role as a Y-PERN policy fellow over the past couple of years, I’ve been working with South Yorkshire Combined Mayoral Authority and others on data for regional economic thinking. As a result of that, I’ve built up a data toolkit while digging into UK sectors, growth and other econ-adjacent data.\nOver the next six months or so as Y-PERN continues, I want to make this a more focused project. The plan is roughly this:\nI’m gathering data/code/explanations onto a regecontools website, though bits are spread all over. This live outputs page on the techie blog has gathered most of it in one place. (Fun1 example interactive: South Yorkshire’s job count from 2023 BRES data; click to drill down through local authority and sector granularity.)\nThe least tested part of this for me, and maybe the most interesting, is the ‘tools/ideas/questions’ cycle. The tools/concepts we use to make sense of our regional economies have grown from a hodgepodge of ideas. These can be questioned at different levels - from narrowly methodological (“Do existing measures of public sector output capture their real value? Have we understood what impact boundary choice has?”) through to deeper, more political ideas about what economies are and what/who they’re for (see e.g. the latest doughnut economics Nature paper or this survey of over 200 eco-econs/wellbeing indicators).\nY-PERN’s whole purpose has been to experiment with breaking down barriers in this cycle - trying to push past deficit model thinking that just sees that cycle as a “transfer of information from experts to non-experts”. This is still a pretty entrenched view: academics toil in the dark for years, emerge pale and blinking, clutching new insights. A separate ‘knowledge exchange’ process then commences.\nBut that doesn’t align with the reality of data-driven policymaking: everyone involved are experts in what they do. It’s a deeply collaborative endeavour. We don’t all share the same knowledge, but we also won’t progress much without bringing everyone’s together.\nThe ‘open’ part of the toolkit is in symbiosis with the ‘ideas/questions’ part. Regions face many of the same economic questions, including identical asks from central government (e.g. to produce Local Growth Plans). The same data sources are re-used, the same assumptions. At the same time, we’re all working to develop our own identities as devolution deepens. Given that, here’s the philosophy I want to work with:\nI don’t have a dogmatic fealty to open source — we have a data/analysis mixed economy where private providers can do things other can’t, and that’s a good thing. There are also essential datasets that can’t be open, for good reason. But where we can, working in the open just goes better with the grain of those three things: (1) collaborative learning/capacity building across silos; (2) developing our shared sense of ground truth; (3) avoiding wheel reinvention (a facet of reproducibility, which needs open methods; you can’t reproduce something if you can’t access it).\nThe only way this works is if we prototype. Or call that test and learn if you prefer. As that doc says:\nSounds great in principle - but we have to be open to our preconceptions being challenged when we smack into reality. The Valve Games employee manual puts it like this2:\nWhile not always comfortable, this is part of how to grow our shared sense of ground truth by working together. It’s perfect ‘blind people and elephant’ parable territory3. Brace for an extremely mixed elephant/economy metaphor.\nCombining openness and prototyping, though, we can exchange what we think we’ve seen with others, maybe learn from our errors, and move a step or two closer to a collective sense of shape.\nThen there are awkward people saying things like, “Are we sure this is an elephant? I think maybe we have to go back to first principles here.” But again - an open, testing approach lets us argue our competing pachyderm theories out, and often discover diverse tools can be used in different places very effectively despite no total agreement.\nThat can hit up against very different incentives and cadences across academia and policymaking (as SYMCA’s Alice Rubbra lays out here really clearly) - but those are other elements to test as we go. What mix of relationships and structures can we grow to get closer to truly learning, adaptive regions?\nSo, what next? I’ll need to keep things fairly narrow to achieve anything at all, most likely by testing some ONS and Companies-House-extracted economy measures, see what can be improved, what blind spots there are. I’ll also try to find two or three focused problems to apply this to - including, I’m hoping, something on how we close the gap between quant views of sector mix and ground level knowledge of how firms interact, and what difference that makes to their success.\nUnderlying-idea-wise, I’d like to see how older theories of technical changes in production can help shed light on current AI fears (I’m also working on an AI impact project). That could help think through where we want economic progress to come from.\nLet’s see how contact with reality changes things…"

    "section": "",
    "text": "I wrote a sci-fi book about artificial intelligence. I started the research for it in 2018, from an idea I’d had in 2012. A first draft was done by mid 2021. After no luck pitching to agents, I lovingly disassembled that draft and put it back together by the following summer in 2022, then churned through another round of agent pitches (also nope).\nA few months later, at the end of 2022, openAI released chatGPT 3.5 for public use. Three years have since passed. That Oatmeal panel above (from this piece) is how a lot of people feel now about AI - there’s a decent chance you’d be willing to pay to make everyone please shut up about it, please stop inserting it into our lives whether we ask for it or no.\nAmid this ceaseless cacophony, I am planning to get the book out into the world. Great timing. I’ve set myself this aim:\nI’ll be re-assessing the book scene by scene in this final loop, writing about the ideas and the construction of it. It has to remain a product of its pre-chatGPT time. It’s a bad idea to let current events blow one’s ideas around like a weathervane. But our brave new LLM world (bubble pop or not) does offer a chance to reflect. How much has it (a) changed how I think about the book and (b) changed how I think about AI and its impact on us?\nI’ll be journaling progress as I go in this planning/work doc (partly to be open, partly a post-LLM urge to demonstrate the flailing human frightfulness of the process).\nAnyone who knows me knows I struggle to see the value of my own work. The book has plenty of flaws, but I’m super-proud of it. This never happens. I feel baffingly, DunningKrugerly confident in it. I’ve worked hard to mix ideas with pace, to write something fun. Your definition of fun may differ, but I think a certain kind of sci-fi fan (i.e. people like me) will dig it. I’m going to roll with that feeling before my brain notices.\nSo stick your email in the subscribe box if…\n(I’ll mark sci-fi related posts, in case you want to avoid other stuff I write about.)\nIn my day-job, I’m now working on analysis of AI workplace impacts. Given that, writing about sci-fi feels a bit like running through town wearing nothing but a fez and a feather boa: equally mortifying and liberating, potentially illegal. But it’s how I was schooled - in the last year of my Sheffield politics degree, Mike Kenny paired social theory with sci-fi every week2. I was introduced there to what’s arguably still my favourite book, Le Guin’s Dispossessed. (We didn’t have to wear just a fez and feather boa in seminars though.) Causal arrows between our imaginations and reality go in all directions (though that has issues - see below)."

    "text": "Planz / ramblinz\n\nSome ways to approach this\nThis is a first bunch of thoughts. But one thing that would be good to do sometimes:\n\nStart with the data, follow breadcrumbs, see where that story takes me when I dig deeper.\n\nSo the Sheffield Testing Company story doesn’t follow that pattern, but then it doesn’t need to. That can be its own thing. I’d love to know what and who else they were testing for and how much has changed.\n..\nWhat kind of piece is this, and what do I want from it? I take the ‘following breadcrumbs’ point, but it might be nice to think about what focus I’d want and what the point is. I have ideas about trying to pitch pieces to the Shef Tribune. That would be something quite different to a free-form piece just exploring the sources.\nIt’s probably OK that I don’t know what ‘the story’ is yet. The tricky part is allowing myself to explore freely without nagging voices: “What are the opportunity costs?? Why are you wasting time??”"

    "text": "Research\n\nLevant mine\nAmazing video (year old) - this time stamp is where the Man Engine explanation starts. It was installed in 1857. 1000 ft wooden rod. 137 times to get up or down. 30 mins versus 90 mins to climb (and risk falling from exhaustion). https://youtu.be/uH0W5AK4bwI?t=346\nHuh. It was ancient tech - other mines using lifts (don’t think possible in that shaft?) Or two-pole man engines that doubled the speed.\nMen had told management it wasn’t safe…\n5 years since the bracket that broke was replaced.\nThe top 300 foot of the rod broke off and fell into the shaft.\nInteresting: fault identified in the bracket led to it being labelled an ‘accident’, owners not liable. Despite other places having much safer systems. So no compensation to families of dead and injured.\n..\nFrom the original Levant mine man engine report.\nhttps://nmrs.org.uk/mines-map/accidents-disasters/cornwall-devon/accident-at-levant-tin-mine-1919/\n“The balanced load amounted to about 14 tons. When the shift of 150 men were on the rod their weight increased the unbalanced load to about 24 tons.”\n150!!\n“A full investigation took place and the caps which were made of faggotted iron were tested at the Sheffield Testing Works was found to be not uniform in quality owing to the method of manufacture. The inquest and inquiry was opened in the Levant Mining Company’s Offices an occupied two full days and conducted by Mr. Edward Boase, H.M. Coroner for the Western District of the County. All interested parties were represented and the jury brought in the verdict that the men died due to-\nAccidental Death, the cause being the breaking of a strap plate due to fatigue of a defective part of the metal.”\n..\n“Transport of copper ore to Penzance until the 1840s was by mule train, each mule carrying about three hundredweight (150 kilos) in two sacks slung across a wooden pack saddle. In 1836 the Reverend Symonds, visiting Levant, described how “The ore………is sent over the Channel to Swansea for smelting, in sacks about as the thick part of one’s thigh.” So Levant’s first sale of 11 tons (a ton in this case being 21 cwt) would have required 77 mule loads to get it to Penzance. In fact the evidence indicates that the ore was taken to Penzance in sacks but shipped to Swansea loose.”\nhttps://www.penwithlocalhistorygroup.co.uk/on-this-day/?id=93\n\n\nSheffield Testing Works\nHere’s the Companies House entry for (now London registered) Element Materials Technology Sheffield. Note - list of older names includes the original Sheffield Testing Works, from 1903 when it was incorporated. Orig incorporation doc from 1903 here. From that:\nThe objects of the Company:\n“To carry on the business of general testers of the strength and quality of iron and steel and other metals, iron founders, mechanical engineers, and manufacturers of implements and other machinery, tool makers, brass founders, metal workers, boiler makers, millwrights, machinists, iron and steel converters, smiths, wood workers, builders, painters, metallurgists, electrical engineers, water supply engineers, carriers and merchants, and to buy, sell, manufacture, repair, convert, let on hire, and deal in machinery, implements, rolling stock, and hardward of all kinds, and to carry on any other business (manufacturing or otherwise) which may seem to the Company capable of being conveniently carried on in connection with the above, or otherwise calculated, directly or indirectly, to enhance the value of any of the Company’s property and rights for the time being.”\n..\nhttps://www.gracesguide.co.uk/Sheffield_Testing_Works\n“The Sheffield Testing Company (before they moved to Nursery Street) fronting Blonk Street occupied a corner of the Smithfield Market. (small building in front of Castle Grinding Wheel in the above photographs)” https://www.sheffieldhistory.co.uk/forums/topic/20026-smithfield-market/\nFounded by Thomas Nash: “In 1880 he conceived the idea of establishing an independent testing and experimenting works in Sheffield. He took great pride in turning out accurate work, with the result that his business grew rapidly, and he found it advisable to add a chemical laboratory to his mechanical testing laboratory. In the course of his work he was frequently consulted regarding breakdowns of various kinds.” “Also a member of the Iron and Steel Institute.” https://www.gracesguide.co.uk/Thomas_Nash\nHis son Tom took over but only lived seven years longer than his father. https://www.gracesguide.co.uk/Thomas_Nash_(d.1910)\nhttps://www.28dayslater.co.uk/threads/ferodo-house-sheffield-march-2018.112705/ Element used to be here (urban explorer)\nNow at Magna Way - website has a little of the history. (Note accreditions.) https://www.element.com/locations/europe/sheffield-magna-way\nCurrent Company Name Element, registered in London. Note previous names still recorded https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/company/00076383\nNote what it’s classified as versus how central to metals (though much broader now): “74909 - Other professional, scientific and technical activities not elsewhere classified”\nElement now owns it; though they bought Exova. Now Element is owned by Temasek Holdings (minority stakef 2019, owns as of 2022). https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Element_Materials_Technology#:~:text=Element%20was%20acquired%20by%20Temasek,valued%20at%20circa%20$4bn.\n..\nPick of Sheffield Testing and Experimentation Works, 1928. Featuring many cows.\nhttps://www.picturesheffield.com/frontend.php?action=printdetails&keywords=Ref_No_increment%3BEQUALS%3By00893&prevUrl=\n..\n“For instance, nothing could be much more artistic than the view from the bridge across the Don at the Sheffield Testing Works. One does not generally associate with Sheffield, in one’s mind, anything quite so charming in its effect as this striking picture.\n“But if you enter one of the large manufactories for which Sheffield is famous, such as the Cyclops Works of Messrs. Charles Cammell and Co., or the Atlas Works of Messrs. John Brown and Co., or the Works of Messrs. Firth or Messrs. Vickers—names of firms which by no means exhaust the list—you will instantaneously receive a very different set of impressions. \n“It is not too much to say that the keynote of these impressions is one of terror.”\nhttps://decollected.net/novel/pearsons-main/sheffield/\n..\nLater… now subsumed into UK firm Element Materials (wikipedia), which has itself been conglomerated into a Singapore organisation, Temasek holdings. State owned multinational investment group. “While Temasek is largely considered as being a sovereign wealth fund (SWF), there are major differences as it invests mostly in equities, is the outright owner of many assets and companies.”\nSo it’s now state-owned by Singapore. Wow. Net value as of March 2025 close to 0.5 TRILLION dollars… https://www.temasek.com.sg/en/our-investments/our-portfolio\nThat portfolio site nicely shows what sectors it’s spread across. UK-wise, ‘major investments’ only one other firm, and that one only 17% stake vs 88% for Element (“EM Topco LTD”). (“EM Topco Limited is the holding company for Element Materials Technology Group Limited.”)"

Otherwise this will go on forever and I’ll never have a beer again.\nA key question: just how much work do I think is possible/realistic? Also, what’s sensible? At a certain point we get firmly into flogging-dead-cheval territory. Yes, there are ways to make it better. But there are opportunity costs for other things I might want to write/do.\nOooon the other hand… I do want to honour the book as much as I can. I do actually want to see if I can get it out there in some form that people might actually read.\nOn point #1, I thought I’d already noted those down. Apparently not. So let’s maybe start with that.

(Or was it a pantsing too far?)\n\nWhat would be compelling? What’s whole hill structure/arc?\n\np.84: Hill - “Work was destroyed”. Can I think through a better thing to convey the hole she’s in? What kind of hole is she actually in anyway? This is classic Princess falls on hard times type thing isn’t it?\n\nHow to get the reader into Hill’s head on this? Plus, does it actually make sense?
