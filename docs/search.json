What systems can we build to maximise our chances of being more than that?” (Two examples of older posts about this: how humans are natural distributed systems makers, what Balinese rice pest management, Peruvian potato growing and the market economy have in common, why it’s all tangled up with magic and why it means Hayek was wrong; picking apart Jordan Peterson’s tediously shallow neoliberalism that underpins his climate nonsense, as a reminder that we are not, in fact, just mindless ants).\nI wrote a sci-fi book about AI, which I finished in the summer of 2022 after four years of research/writing… a couple of months before the 1st chatGPT public release. I’m going to do one more re-draft before self-publishing (after failed attempts to foist it on real publishers2). I’ll write about this process, as well as the book’s ideas and themes in an “LLM before / after” light. What still works, what doesn’t? Is there any point when every other social media post and news story is now about AI? It’s a terrible idea to retrofit too heavily based on new info, but a few tweaks might be fun."

    "text": "About me / this site\nI called my first ever blog ‘coveredinbees’ back in 2006 before embarking on a PhD. The name was an Izzard-flavoured hat-tip to the emergence / self-organisation ideas I planned to study. (Someone later pointed out I could also have linked to the Fable of the Bees, didn’t think of that at the time.)\nEarly posts (a few surviving on the wayback machine) like this were largely unstructured rambles of faintly connected thoughts. Various incarnations survived over the years; this archive was the last one and this page lists my favourite bits.\nTwenty years later, of course, through diligent practice and academic training, my writing is now like a scalpel.\nHahahaha. I jest. No. I did manage to write a PhD (in twice the time I was supposed to) and that sci-fi book I mentioned. But from those early puppyish, over-enthusiastic ramblings of youth, I have passed through trying to be something I’m not, back in my autumn years3 to “Aaaaa just get on with the rambling. Who cares? We’ll all be dead soon.”\nSlightly less flippantly… coveredinbees (and early C21st blogging generally, a world that still survives at the margins) allowed a kind of free exploration and experimentation that I miss. That dovetails with the direction work is taking, as I’m playing with opening up economic tools and ideas.\nSetting this up to work through Quarto and github is considerably more faff than, say, signing up for Substack. But this gives me more control and ownership as well as leaving an accountability trail - everything here is on my own machine as well as stored on github (admittedly, owned by Microsoft). If anyone so desires - why would you, that’d be mad, but if you wanted to - you could look at the history of any file (here’s this one’s) and see what’s changed (e.g. a recent commit difference). You could even sign up to github and add comments.\nIn our bold new LLM world, this is also one way to show it’s this particular dumb, stumbling meatsack erratically flapping at the keys.\nAnd why make things simple when they can be complicated? The Douglas Adams principle of programming:\n\n“I am rarely happier than when spending an entire day programming my computer to perform automatically a task that would otherwise take me a good ten seconds to do by hand.”"

As a few people have put it (e.g. here, here, here) humans just lost their monopoly on written language to robots that digested everything ever written, Johnny-5 style (OK, not like that).\nBut the machinery of language has been radically rewiring for decades, as informatics have worked their way into every cell1.\nWords are the sinews of social and scientific progress. Informatics has already upended older ways these sinews stay supple and strengthen. It’s also opened us up to human-comms equivalents of distributed denial of service attacks - really nothing more sophisticated than a bunch of people constantly shouting nonsense while others in the room try to think. But it’s been dismayingly effective (climate example in Nature), and LLMs may be pouring petrol on that (see e.g. openAI here, here, also here).\nScience (and all knowledge flavours that accrete around universities and other research sites) is a still-surviving modernist structure built up layer by layer through argument and counter-argument2, a somehow-functioning mix of reason and chance. Science is struggling. It’s trying to adapt to new tech, or through inertia failing to. It’s shaken by Language DDOS (climate science under attack; ‘sick of experts’; in the U.S., direct authoritarian attacks)."

    "text": "BITS\nThis is all deeply political, of course. Authoritarians want to be the sole source of truth, and twist words accordingly. The internet age suits them just fine. But there’s a lot of weird Venn diagram overlap with its apparent opposite, libertarian truthiness3. See Peter Thiel talking about Eric Weinstein’s term, the ‘Distributed Idea Suppression Complex’. As Thiel puts it, ’The internet has already begun our liberation from the DISC prison… the media organisations, bureaucracies, universities and government-funded NGOs that traditionally delimited public conversation”.\nGramscian cultural hegemony comparisons abound, so that’s nothing new - and I’m not disagreeing that institutions use words to shape reality. What’s striking is DISC’s banality. You can see the same in Musk’s take on Twitter/X:\n\n“Because it consists of billions of bidirectional interactions per day, Twitter can be thought of as a collective, cybernetic, super-intelligence.”\n\nIt’s that sufficient-condition “because of” that gets me. Nope, it’s not intelligent because of those interactions. My cup of tea consists of trillions of bidirectional interactions. It has no smarts. This is exactly the same wilful error that Hayekian thinking is often guilty of (more-so than Hayek himself I think) - if you tear things down, a magic fairy dust will ‘emerge’ to replace it. And if you get in the way of that happening, you’re part of the DISC / woke mind virus.\nIntriguing that the outcome ends up following the grain of authoritarianism - that can be seen in the targets that both attack. Both have implicit theories of truth that seem so opposite: one sole, all-controlling source versus an emergent, everywhere-truth that no-one controls. But the effect on the machinery of knowledge generation is more or less identical. Compare to the famous Arendt quote from Truth and Politics:\n\n“The result of a consistent and total substitution of lies for factual truth is not that the lie will now be accepted as truth and truth be defamed as lies, but that the sense by which we take our bearings in the real world - and the category of truth versus falsehood is among the mental means to this end - is being destroyed.”\n\nThat italiced chunk applies equally to both flavours of the right I’m talking about.\nLet’s not push the parallel too far. Libertarians aren’t into disappearing people off the street for what they say. But that’s why the childishness of DISC thinking is so frustrating - it seems content to enable its opposite.\nSo that’s the world that LLMs have entered, that we find ourselves in now. The (actually very useful) idea of emergence is weaponised, paving the way for authoritarians to tediously re-prove Arendt over and over, with added trollfarms. To the extent that DISC thinking has a point - knowledge structures are dominated by white males on computers like me, by wealthy global institutions, of which universities are certainly members - they let the actual point go sailing past: addressing this means exactly the kind of ‘how do we get more voices in here?’ thinking most of them seem to loath."

    "section": "",
    "text": "I wrote a sci-fi book about artificial intelligence. I started the research for it in 2018, from an idea I’d had in 2012. A first draft was done by mid 2021. After no luck pitching to agents, I lovingly disassembled that draft and put it back together by the following summer in 2022, then churned through another round of agent pitches (also nope).\nA few months later, at the end of 2022, openAI released chatGPT 3.5 for public use. Three years have since passed. That Oatmeal panel above (from this piece) is how a lot of people feel now about AI - there’s a decent chance you’d be willing to pay to make everyone please shut up about it, stop inserting it into our lives whether we ask for it or no.\nAmid this ceaseless cacophony, I am planning to get the book out into the world. Great timing. I’ve set myself this aim:\nI’ll be re-assessing the book scene by scene in this final loop, using that to write about the ideas and the construction of it. It has to remain a product of its pre-chatGPT time. It’s a bad idea to let current events blow one’s ideas around like a weathervane. But our brave new LLM world (bubble pop or not) does offer a chance to reflect. How much has it (a) changed how I think about the book and (b) changed how I think about AI and its impact on us?\nAnyone who knows me knows I struggle to see the value of my own work. The book has plenty of flaws, but I’m super-proud of it. This never happens. I feel baffingly, DunningKrugerly confident in it. I’ve worked hard to mix ideas with pace, to write something fun. Your definition of fun may differ, but I think a certain kind of sci-fi fan (i.e. people like me) will dig it. I’m going to roll with that feeling before my brain notices.\nSo stick your email in the subscribe box if…\nAaah go on.\nIn my day-job, I’m now working on analysis of AI job impacts. Given that, writing about sci-fi feels a bit like running through town wearing nothing but a fez and a feather boa: equally mortifying and liberating, potentially illegal. But it’s how I was schooled - in the last year of my Sheffield politics degree, Mike Kenny paired social theory with sci-fi every week2. I was introduced there to what’s arguably still my favourite book, Le Guin’s Dispossessed. Causal arrows between our imaginations and reality go in all directions (though that has issues - see below). (We didn’t have to wear just a fez and feather boa though.)"

    "text": "Over the past couple of years, I’ve been building up a loose ‘regional economics’ toolkit while digging into UK sectors, growth and other econ-adjacent data (working mainly with SYMCA wearing my Y-PERN hat)1.\nI’m gathering data/code/explanations onto a regecontools website, though bits are spread all over. This live outputs page on the techie blog has gathered most of it in one place. (Fun2 example interactive: South Yorkshire’s job count from 2023 BRES data; click to drill down through local authority and sector granularity.)\nOver the next six months or so, I want to make this a more focused project. The plan is roughly this:\nThe least tested part of this for me, and maybe the most interesting, is the ‘tools/ideas/questions’ cycle. The tools/concepts we use to make sense of our regional economies have grown from a hodgepodge of ideas. These can be questioned at different levels - from narrowly methodological (“Do existing measures of public sector output capture their real value? Have we understood what impact boundary choice has?”) through to deeper, more political ideas about what economies are and what/who they’re for (see e.g. the latest doughnut economics Nature paper or this survey of over 200 eco-econs/wellbeing indicators).\nY-PERN’s whole purpose has been to experiment with breaking down barriers in this cycle - trying to push past deficit model thinking that just sees that cycle as a “transfer of information from experts to non-experts”. This is still a pretty entrenched view: academics toil in the dark for years, emerge pale and blinking, clutching new insights. A separate ‘knowledge exchange’ process then commences.\nBut that doesn’t align with the reality of data-driven policymaking: everyone involved are experts in what they do. It’s a deeply collaborative endeavour. We don’t all share the same knowledge, but we also won’t progress much without bringing everyone’s together.\nThe ‘open’ part of the toolkit is in symbiosis with the ‘ideas/questions’ part. Regions face many of the same economic questions, including identical asks from central government (e.g. to produce Local Growth Plans). The same data sources are re-used, the same assumptions. At the same time, we’re all working to develop our own identities as devolution deepens. Given that, here’s the philosophy I want to work with:\nI don’t have a dogmatic fealty to open source — we have a data/analysis mixed economy where private providers can do things other can’t, and that’s a good thing. There are also essential datasets that can’t be open, for good reason. But where we can, working in the open just goes better with the grain of those three things: (1) collaborative learning/capacity building across silos; (2) developing our shared sense of ground truth; (3) avoiding wheel reinvention (a facet of reproducibility, which needs open methods; you can’t reproduce something if you can’t access it).\nThe only way this works is if we prototype.

    "text": "Over the past couple of years, I’ve been building up a loose ‘regional economics’ toolkit while digging into UK sectors, growth and other econ-adjacent data (working mainly with SYMCA wearing my Y-PERN hat)1.\nI’m gathering data/code/explanations onto a regecontools website, though bits are spread all over. This live outputs page on the techie blog has gathered most of it in one place. (Fun2 example interactive: South Yorkshire’s job count from 2023 BRES data; click to drill down through local authority and sector granularity.)\nOver the next six months or so, I want to make this a more focused project. The plan is roughly this:\nThe least tested part of this for me, and maybe the most interesting, is the ‘tools/ideas/questions’ cycle. The tools/concepts we use to make sense of our regional economies have grown from a hodgepodge of ideas. These can be questioned at different levels - from narrowly methodological (“Do existing measures of public sector output capture their real value? Have we understood what impact boundary choice has?”) through to deeper, more political ideas about what economies are and what/who they’re for (see e.g. the latest doughnut economics Nature paper or this survey of over 200 eco-econs/wellbeing indicators).\nY-PERN’s whole purpose has been to experiment with breaking down barriers in this cycle - trying to push past deficit model thinking that just sees that cycle as a “transfer of information from experts to non-experts”. This is still a pretty entrenched view: academics toil in the dark for years, emerge pale and blinking, clutching new insights. A separate ‘knowledge exchange’ process then commences.\nBut that doesn’t align with the reality of data-driven policymaking: everyone involved are experts in what they do. It’s a deeply collaborative endeavour. We don’t all share the same knowledge, but we also won’t progress much without bringing everyone’s together.\nThe ‘open’ part of the toolkit is in symbiosis with the ‘ideas/questions’ part. Regions face many of the same economic questions, including identical asks from central government (e.g. to produce Local Growth Plans). The same data sources are re-used, the same assumptions. At the same time, we’re all working to develop our own identities as devolution deepens. Given that, here’s the philosophy I want to work with:\nI don’t have a dogmatic fealty to open source — we have a data/analysis mixed economy where private providers can do things other can’t, and that’s a good thing. There are also essential datasets that can’t be open, for good reason. But where we can, working in the open just goes better with the grain of those three things: (1) collaborative learning/capacity building across silos; (2) developing our shared sense of ground truth; (3) avoiding wheel reinvention (a facet of reproducibility, which needs open methods; you can’t reproduce something if you can’t access it).\nThe only way this works is if we prototype. Or call that test and learn if you prefer. As that doc says:\nSounds great in principle - but we have to be open to our preconceptions being challenged when we smack into reality.

    "text": "BITS\n\nWe already have incredible data. The issue is finding ways to make it talk. (That’s not to say we don’t need more and better data, see below…)\n\nExample: regional sector output from the ONS. I’ve used a bunch of different data sources in my time with SYMCA so far, but this is the one I’ve returned to the most. (Their original data; my nice machine-readable / combined-with-job-data version.) It’s the entire UK spatial economy squeezed into a tiny set of numbers. It allows you to see granular economic history going back to 1998, see huge structural shifts. You can see where we’ve come from - absolutely essential for figuring out where we’re heading.\nIt’s not the kind of dataset that makes people swoon, the opposite of Big Data (do we still talk about that any more?), nothing to do with AI. It’s just a high-concentrate distillation of economic goodness in a tiny package. I keep on finding new things in there it can show us all the time (and sometimes things in there that suggest it’s a little bit eccentric).\n(Yes, regional GVA numbers need slathering in caveats — I’ll do that another time, though the ONS explain how the sausage is made here and how much is “observed vs estimated vs modelled” here. And I’m just reading Diane Coyle’s latest book where she is very affectionately working up to suggesting national accounts need euthenising…)\nAll that awesomeness is hidden in an excel document. ONS have their own analysis (latest here) with some nice findings and interactives. But it isn’t easy to ask deeper questions about your own region or place it in historical/spatial context. Through my experience of trying to do that for SYMCA, I’ve built a range of ways to see what’s in that excel document — and through that process, I’ve come to think we should be able to build better shared tools. Everyone’s asking broadly the same questions, after all — there’s a tonne of wheel-reinvention going on to extract the answers.\nThis is in no way meant as a criticism of ONS, who are doing incredible work getting this data to us and, through ONS Local, supporting regional policymakers. I went on ad nauseum about the “huge value and power” of ONS data at their regional data conference last November.\nIf you’re interested in the nuts and bolts, [this post] runs through some R code to illustrate the point — a pipeline direct from that opaque excel file through to insights in straightforward, reproducible steps. Using the same pipeline, and all in code, we can build reports, maps, dashboards etc. and share them easily. Once we have that, we can puzzle our way to what it means for our regions, what theories of change we believe it supports, what blindspots and problems the data has — but a data platform like this underpinning it smooths the path considerably.\nMore recently, I’ve been re-using these tools to help other Yorkshire government bodies get insights quickly. This came about quite serendipitously, but it’s helped convince me it’s a good way to work. [Explain something about how much it speeds things up / how cost effective it is]\n(This is all on my github where I’m trying to corral more of it into the regecontools site, itself a github repo; the website’s all generated using R.)\nI’m not suggesting how I’ve approached this is anything like the best way - but I am arguing that building these pipelines openly leads to good things that otherwise couldn’t happen. What I’d love to see is what others can do, and what kind of tools we could build together.\nAnd then something on: why the orig data sources are not enough. Just supplying openly isn’t enough. Without capacity to see what’s in that data, you’re still blind. What exactly does that capacity look like and how do we build it?"
