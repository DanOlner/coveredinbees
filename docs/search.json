    "text": "Welcome to coveredinbees, a site where I waffle, mull, connect and maybe over time try to hone thoughts into something more digestible.\nYou’ve got the option of subscribing to first drafts here, as well as final drafts (RSS links).\nThe email subscription option defaults to final pieces only - tick the ‘1st draft’ box you want in on the 1st drafts.\nWhy on Earth would I be giving you the option to read 1st drafts? Isn’t life short enough already? Brief answer followed by longer ramble.\nAlso - why write when you can instead spend far too long setting up complex writing systems? What kind of fool just writes?\nOK, the longer version.\nWords have been getting a bit of a kicking lately. Looming in everyone’s vision right now is (as a few people have put it e.g. here, here, here) that humans just lost their monopoly on written language to robots that digested everything ever written, Johnny-5 style (OK, not like that).\nBut while everyone argues about just how radical the LLM shift is, the machinery of language has been altering for a good while longer as informatics has worked its way into every cell over the last few decades2.\nIt’s obvious to state, but words are the sinews of social and scientific progress. Informatics is upending much of its old ways of growing, and it’s opened us up to language equivalents of distributed denial of service attacks - nothing more sophisticated, really, than a bunch of people constantly shouting nonsense while others are in the room trying to think. But it’s been effective nonetheless (climate example in Nature), and LLMs may be pouring petrol on that (see e.g. openAI here, here, also here).\nScience (and all other knowledge flavours that accrete around universities) is a still-surviving modernist structure built up layer by layer through argument and counter-argument3, a somehow-functioning mix of reason and chance. Science is struggling. Again, it’s a mix of the fundamentals - how knowledge production is adapting to new tech, or through inertia failing to, and all the ways language DDOS is affecting it (climate science under attack; ‘sick of experts’; in the U.S., direct authoritarian attacks).\nIt’s unavoidably political, of course. Authoritarians want to be the sole source of truth, and twist words accordingly. The internet age suits them just fine. But there’s a lot of weird Venn diagram overlap with its apparent opposite, libertarian truthiness. See Peter Thiel talking about Eric Weinstein’s term, the ‘Distributed Idea Suppression Complex’. As Thiel puts it, ’the internet has already begun our liberation from the DISC prison… the media organisations, bureaucracies, universities and government-funded NGOs that traditionally delimited public conversation”.\nGramscian cultural hegemony comparisons abound, so that’s nothing new - and I’m not dismissing the notion that institutions use words to shape reality. What’s striking is its banality. You can see the same in Musk’s take on Twitter/X:\nIt’s that sufficient-condition “because of” that gets me. Nope, it’s not intelligent because of those interactions. My cup of tea consists of trillions of bidirectional interactions. It has no smarts. This is exactly the same wilful error that Hayekian thinking is often guilty of (more-so than Hayek himself I think) - if you tear things down, some kind of fairy dust will ‘emerge’ to replace it. And if you get in the way of that happening, you’re part of the DISC / woke mind virus.\nIntriguing that the outcome ends up following the grain of authoritarianism - that can be seen in the targets that both attack. Both have implicit theories of truth that seem so opposite: one sole, all-controlling source versus an emergent, everywhere-truth that no-one controls. But the effect on the machinery of knowledge generation is more or less identical. Compare to the famous Arendt quote from Truth and Politics:\nLet’s not push the parallel too far. Libertarians aren’t into disappearing people off the street for what they say. But that’s why the childishness of DISC thinking is so frustrating - it seems content to enable its opposite.\nSo that’s the world that LLMs have entered, that we find ourselves in now. The (actually very useful) idea of emergence is weaponised by right wing idiots, paving the way for authoritarians to tediously re-prove Arendt over and over, with added trollfarms. To the extent that DISC thinking has a point - knowledge structures are dominated by white males on computers like me - they let the actual point go sailing past: addressing this means exactly the kind of ‘how to diversify voices effectively’ thinking most of them seem to loath.\nSo yes. Another blog will help, I think.\nOK, try again. What I like about github, and openly writing there, is all those things I mentioned above - openness, visibility, accountability, ownership. (Shhh about Microsoft, shhhh.) But in these systems, one can also see ways to make knowledge in a distributed way, in a place where there’s enough of a level of control to balance collaboration and safety.\nIt’s possible. Places already exist where this has worked. Wikipedia is straight-up brilliant (entirely unsurprising people like Musk should attack it), well-designed tech channelling collaboration into incremental improvements while keeping the idiots at bay."

All other options are horrible e.g. information ecosystem was about the best I could find, not great. Anything better?↩︎\nA Bauman point, that one: modernism - “a ‘total’ order to be erected floor by floor in a protracted, consistent, purpose-guided effort of labour.” (Liquid modernity)↩︎"

Separate out all the different types e.g. tiny incremental technical progress in papers (some patenting to get IP) is a very different world to e.g. open urban work. Structures vastly different. Or exploratory thought pieces vs medical testing. Put in context of what we do not want to happen: what happened with supposed ‘citizen science’ for climate change, which was just idiots shouting “I am Galileo!” Some but not all of those oil-funded, some but not all of those with raging Dunning-Kruger. (Cf. constructive stupidity.)\nOther random points:\n\nNow equivalent of DDOS attack via LLMs…?\nNew tools? Github as way to produce, review, edit in a fully open and traceable way?\nThe ostensible goal: continue to increase real knowledge a slice at a time. But what role does or could knowledge systems play in this? Back to the original “how does science / how does knowledge growth actually work vs how we imagine it should”. Overlaps with the demarcation problem / shows up in arguments around scientism. (That’s a really great wikipedia article on the subject)."

    "text": "Musings\nI called my first ever blog ‘coveredinbees’ back in 2006 before embarking on a PhD. The name was an Izzard-flavoured hat-tip to the emergence / self-organisation ideas I planned to study. (Someone later pointed out I could also have linked to the Fable of the Bees, didn’t think of that at the time.) Early posts (a few surviving on the wayback machine) like this were largely unstructured rambles of faintly connected thoughts. Various incarnations survived over the years; this archive was the last one and this page lists my favourite bits.\nTwenty years later, of course, through diligent practice and academic training, my writing is now like a scalpel. Hahahaha. I jest. No. I did manage to write a PhD (in twice the time I was supposed to) and a sci-fi book (more on that soon). But from those early puppyish, over-enthusiastic ramblings of youth, I have passed into the autumn years of once again thinking, “Aaaaa just get on with the rambling. Who cares? We’ll all be dead soon.”\nSlightly less flippantly… coveredinbees (and early C21st century blogging generally, a world that still survives at the margins) allowed a kind of free exploration and experimentation that I miss. That dovetails with the direction work is going in, as I’m playing with opening up economic tools and ideas through github. That site leans heavily towards the narrow how-to stuff - I want to open that up, connect to “so what” and arguments around things like how we measure, how we connect ideas through to tools.\nAnd why make things simple when they can be complicated? Setting this up to work through Quarto and github is considerably more faff than, say, signing up for substack. But as I go on about here, there are practical and personal reasons for choosing this kind of path.\nSo let’s see how this goes…\n\np.s. that pic is a killer onion I made for the Sharrow Lantern Carnival in 2006. The teeth flashed and everything."
