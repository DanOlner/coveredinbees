  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Words have been getting a bit of a kicking lately. As a few poeple have noted, humans just lost their monopoly on being able to produce coherent written language…</p>
<p>Is that a good way to start this? Christ, the first paragraph. Never start there. Do the first paragraph <em>last</em>. Obviously. Why is that so hard to remember? Anyway, let’s try that again and explain what I’m trying to do here.</p>
<p>Err. Writing is an interative process. You have to allow yourself the <a href="https://wrd.as.uky.edu/sites/default/files/1-Shitty%20First%20Drafts.pdf">shitty first drafts</a>. For mere humans, SFDs are not optional - plural, for there can be many, many of them before writing approaches anything like coherent, before it can appear like you actually thought up a structured argument in the first place, before you even <em>know</em> what you might be trying to say.</p>
<p>And then something about how we can lean into the SFD, make that process open, and all the reasons that’s a good thing. Or could be a good thing.</p>
