Douglas Adams [said](https://www.reddit.com/r/quotes/comments/btuvib/i_am_rarely_happier_than_when_spending_an_entire):

> “I am rarely happier than when spending an entire day programming my computer to perform automatically a task that would otherwise take me a good ten seconds to do by hand.”

This is exactly the kind of productivity thinking the country needs, I think. I've been trying to follow his example recently. I am trying to disassemble how I do things / why I'm doing them / whether I should I just sit in my pants all day eating pringles / what sort of task-environment-brain re-jigs might help answer any of those questions. This is leading to many "all day programming for a ten second task" moments. 

It's all part of joining in the currently very fashionable and exciting pastime of "wondering what kind of brain I have and whether it really needs to have been so bloody difficult all this time." (Analogy: as a left-hander, if I'd always been made to use my right hand, as was the case pre 1950ish.) Coming at it like a design problem, prototyping things that may end up on the scrapheap, is the only way.

So rather than get on with, say, actually working on the [sci-fi book](https://coveredinbees.org/posts/i_wrote_a_scifi_book/) or writing about anything concrete, I've done the following:

* Made this blog using [Quarto](https://quarto.org) in R and linked it to [buttondown](https://buttondown.com) for subscribers. Autonomy! Open source! No readers!
* Read a bunch about distributed knowledge systems and brain diversity, leading to -->
* Moving to [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) for all note-taking / thinking stuff (it's a delight to use, if you're already a bit markdown-leaning, and again it lets you have transparent control over all your stuff; it can also do lovely clever things like [collate tasks](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Introduction) from all sources).
* Using Obsidian's [Digital Garden plugin](https://dg-docs.ole.dev) to host [exobrain.coveredinbees.org](https://exobrain.coveredinbees.org) via Vercel autopushing to Github, setting a YAML property to dg-publish for any md file I want live (what a super, pretentious two-decades-old-type word 'exobrain' is: see the [ngrams](https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=exobrain%2Cdigital+garden&year_start=1960&year_end=2022&corpus=en&smoothing=3&case_insensitive=false), pic below also - it actually peaked in 2010, though its first ngrams appearance is in 1970, Arthur B. Bronwell's 'Science and Technology in the World of the Future': "to carry out man's informational processing demands in much the same way that an exoskeleton carries out his powerful tasks.")
* Then there's a nice little [obsidian-to-quarto plugin](https://github.com/AndreasThinks/obsidian-to-quarto-exporter). Err why? Because just blogging in Quarto, I'd have to manually add exobrain URLs myself, which would take me a good ten seconds by hand, so instead [I (and chatGPT) made some R functions](https://github.com/DanOlner/coveredinbees/blob/master/functions/obsidian_functions.R) that check for Obsidian exports and, if present, convert all Obsidian internal links to exobrain URLs, as well as reformatting the YAML so the tags work correctly. So for example I can use Obsidian's own internal link system (which has very smooth autofind) to connect to exobrain bits (e.g. a [[Game-money-magic|list of starter questions]] connecting magic, the money system and 'the game').

So now the process of writing a blog post couldn't be simpler. I just (1) write it in Obsidian as I'm doing now; (2) use the Obsidian-to-Quarto export function; (3) in RStudio, run the R function to convert exobrain links and YAML and move the files; (4) when in a state I'm happy to publish, move it manually to the posts folder (that could be streamlined); (5) run 'render' on that final post in RStudio so the HTML goes to the docs folder; (6) git stage/commit and push in Gitraken to get it live on coveredinbees. Done! Just like that. Substack schmubschmack.

Sigh. I am reminded a little of the Mars Curiosity Rover's landing plan (in one of my [all time favourite youtube videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ki_Af_o9Q9s), recorded before they knew whether it would succeed). Aim for a flat spot, use Mars' atmosphere to slow down a little (it's 1% the density of Earth's), use a huge parachute, release a cap to view the ground, drop the rover carried by its own rocket stage because none of that can slow it down enough, but you can't use rockets to land because the dust will bugger the rover's systems - so hover above the ground and lower it on four wires, and then boost the rocket stage off to the side so it doesn't crash on top of the now-on-Mars Curiosity. Oh and do all that entirely automatically because signals to Mars were a 14 minute round trip at the time. Done! Just like that. Elon Schmelon.

Here's Jazz-student turned NASA entry/descent/landing lead [Adam Steltzner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Steltzner):

> "When people look at it, it looks crazy. That's a very natural thing. Sometimes when *we* look at it, it looks crazy. *It is* the result of reasoned engineering thought. But it still looks crazy."

Reasoned engineering thought, though, takes a *lot* of testing. The problem with testing human brains, or at least mine, is the tendency to default to "you're just a useless idiot" and stop at that, rather than taking little steps, inching forward, playing, trying new things, seeing what goes with the grain, what rubs against it. It needs resetting daily as the self-blame module can be deeply wired in - previous perceived failures *obviously* a personal failure, says the module, rather than allowing consideration of the whole you/task/environment setup[^1].

[^1]: Hat tip to my partner Helen for bringing her OT background to bear.

So while I'm obviously getting those sweet sweet Douglas Adams Dopamine Hits from all this ridiculous tinkering, it's... not entirely ridiculous. None of this is novel - [here's a nice writeup](https://jzhao.xyz/posts/networked-thought) of the general digital garden idea, it's in that ballpark. The world is littered with failed 'Systems That Will Solve Everything', but maybe there's merit in this kind of slow, tentative gardening.

All the 'digital garden' tech is allowing is easy linkage - it's been described as 'your own personal wikipedia'. But replicating existing links would seem pointless, no? So the test here is: can it be used to add little modular chunks, questions, connections? In a way that isn't just building an ideas [oubliette](https://muppet.fandom.com/wiki/Oubliette)? What, if anything, can it really add?

I'm finding that when you start playing with the task/environment/self parts, they all start affecting each other in unexpected ways. One of the most intriguing: what it's doing to what I think words are actually *for*. That's led to a [[List of writing questions]] (see, nice exobrain link; sorry, some LLM assistance in that list). There's a long section on different [[List of writing questions#Functions of writing expanding the available options|functions of writing]] where "narrow professional words" are in the minority. There's also writing for one's own brain/ psychology/emotions; connection; experimentation; identity building...

That rather solipsistic view segues into bigger veins and arteries we all share. I [tried "Writing" about that](/drafts/what_happened_to_words/index.html) - it's got some of the ideas there, but... too much. Let's see if it's possible to pick away at it more slowly. It feels like a very specific historical moment for language, when humans have lost their monopoly on the written word (people pointing that out [here](https://www.spglobal.com/en/research-insights/special-reports/language-modeling-the-fundamentals), [here](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11137430/), [here](https://bigwildmindmachine.substack.com/p/the-ny-times-vs-openai)), when the collective lighthouses we used to steer away from the Deathly Rocks of Bullshit are under well-funded, sustained attack. 

That's enough to make it feel like finding your own words is pointless. Working theory: it isn't, it's more important than ever. So let's add that one to the list for later:
