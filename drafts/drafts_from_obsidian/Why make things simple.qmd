Douglas Adams [said](https://www.reddit.com/r/quotes/comments/btuvib/i_am_rarely_happier_than_when_spending_an_entire):

> “I am rarely happier than when spending an entire day programming my computer to perform automatically a task that would otherwise take me a good ten seconds to do by hand.”

This is exactly the kind of productivity thinking the country needs, I think. I've been trying to follow his example recently. I am currently trying to disassemble how I do things / why I'm doing them / whether there's any point in doing them / whether I should I just sit in my pants all day eating pringles / what sort of task-environment-brain re-jigs might help answer any of those questions. 

This is all part of joining in the currently very fashionable and exciting pastime of "wondering what kind of brain I have and whether it really needs to have been so bloody difficult all this time."

So rather than get on with, say, actually working on the [sci-fi book](https://coveredinbees.org/posts/i_wrote_a_scifi_book/) or writing about anything concrete, I've instead done the following:

* Made this blog using [Quarto](https://quarto.org) in R and linked it to [buttondown](https://buttondown.com) for subscribers. Autonomy! Open source! No readers!
* Read a bunch about distributed knowledge systems and brain diversity, leading to -->
* Moving to [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) for all note-taking / thinking stuff (it can do lovely clever things like [collate tasks](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Introduction) from all sources, and is generally just a delight to use, if you're already a bit markdown-leaning, and again it lets you have transparent control over all your stuff).
* Using the [Digital Garden plugin](https://dg-docs.ole.dev) to host [exobrain.coveredinbees.org](https://exobrain.coveredinbees.org) via Vercel autopushing to Github, setting a YAML property to dg-publish for any md file I want live (what a super, pretentious two-decades-old-type word 'exobrain' is; see the [ngram](https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=exobrain%2Cdigital+garden&year_start=1960&year_end=2022&corpus=en&smoothing=3&case_insensitive=false), pic below also - it actually peaked in 2010, though its first ngrams appearance is in 1970, Arthur B. Bronwell's 'Science and Technology in the World of the Future': "to carry out man's informational processing demands in much the same way that an exoskeleton carries out his powerful tasks.")
* Then there's a nice little [obsidian-to-quarto plugin](https://github.com/AndreasThinks/obsidian-to-quarto-exporter). Err why? Because just writing in Quarto, I'd have to manually add exobrain URLs myself, which would take me a good ten seconds by hand, so instead [I (and chatGPT) made some R functions](https://github.com/DanOlner/coveredinbees/blob/master/functions/obsidian_functions.R) that check for Obsidian exports and, if present, convert all Obsidian internal links to exobrain URLs, as well as reformatting the YAML so the tags work correctly. So for example I can [[Game-money-magic|Use Obsidian's own internal link system]] to connect to exobrain bits.

So now the process of writing a blog post couldn't be simpler. I just (1) write it in Obsidian as I'm doing now; (2) use the Obsidia-to-Quarto export function; (3) in RStudio, run the R function to convert exobrain links and YAML and move the files; (4) when in a state I'm happy to publish, move it manually to the posts folder (that could be streamlined); (5) run 'render' on that final post in RStudio so the HTML goes to the docs folder; (6) git stage/commit and push in Gitraken to get it live on coveredinbees. Done! Just like that. Substack schmubschmack.

Sigh. I am reminded a little of Jazz-student turned NASA entry/descent/landing lead [Adam Steltzner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Steltzner) saying, of the Mars Curiosity Rover's landing plan (recorded before he knew whether it would succeed, in one of my [all time favourite youtube videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ki_Af_o9Q9s)):

> "When people look at it, it looks crazy. That's a very natural thing. Sometimes when *we* look at it, it looks crazy. *It is* the result of reasoned engineering thought. But it still looks crazy."

So is there reasoned engineering thought behind all this? Hahaha nope. This is taking little steps, inching forward, playing, trying new things, seeing what goes with the grain, what rubs the wrong way. I dunno, maybe that's a bit how reasoned engineering thought works.

I'm obviously getting those sweet sweet Douglas Adams Dopamine Hits from all this ridiculous tinkering. But also... it's not entirely ridiculous. The tinkering is making links all the time. Not a new thought - [here's a nice writeup](https://jzhao.xyz/posts/networked-thought) of the general digital garden idea, it's in that ballpark. 

One of the grains I'm following: letting myself not know what words are for, trying to disassemble it too. One thing that's led to is (see, nice exobrain link) a [[List of writing questions]]. In that, there's a long list of different [[List of writing questions#Functions of writing expanding the available options|functions of writing]] - within that, the typical kinds of narrow professional functions are in the minority. There's stuff for my own brain and emotions; connection; experimentation; identity building.

From that somewhat solipsistic view, personal writing segues into the bigger veins and arteries we all share. That - everything else - is too big to Write About. Can I pick away at it here? I [tried "Writing" about it](/drafts/what_happened_to_words/index.html) - it's got some of the ideas there, but... too much. Let's see if it's possible to pick away at it and connect on here. How to start at such a turning point for language, when humans have lost their monopoly on the written word (people pointing that out [here](https://www.spglobal.com/en/research-insights/special-reports/language-modeling-the-fundamentals), [here](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11137430/), [here](https://bigwildmindmachine.substack.com/p/the-ny-times-vs-openai)), when whatever collective systems we had for steering towards truth are under well-funded, sustained attack?

Let's add that one to the list for later:

And let blog posts ramble on and then end without a satisfying or convincing argument, mid-sente----
