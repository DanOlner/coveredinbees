Douglas Adams [said](https://www.reddit.com/r/quotes/comments/btuvib/i_am_rarely_happier_than_when_spending_an_entire):

This is exactly the kind of productivity thinking the country needs, I think. I've certainly been taking it to heart myself recently. I am currently trying to disassemble how I do things / why I'm doing them / whether there's any point in doing them / whether I should I just sit in my pants all day staring at the wall / what sort of task-environment-brain re-jigs might help answer any of those questions. 

This is all part of joining in the currently very fashionable and exciting sport of "wondering what kind of brain I have and whether it really needs to have been so bloody difficult all this time."

So rather than get on with, say, actually working on the [sci-fi book](https://coveredinbees.org/posts/i_wrote_a_scifi_book/) or writing about anything else, I've instead done the following:

* Made this blog using [Quarto](https://quarto.org) in R and linked it to [buttondown](https://buttondown.com). Autonomy! Open source! No readers!
* Spent a chunk of time reading about distributed knowledge systems, leading to
* Moving to [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) for all note-taking / thinking stuff (it can do lovely clever things like [collate tasks](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Introduction) from all sources, and is generally just a delight to use, if you're already a bit markdown-leaning, and again lets you have transparent control over all your stuff).
* Using the Digital Garden plugin to host a coveredinbees exobrain (what a super 2006 kind of word - see the ngram pic below, peaked in 2010 - though actually its first use was in )
