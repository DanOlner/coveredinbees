# What's this?

A journal of progress (or lack of it) on getting the sci-fi book self-published and "one last edit"ed prior to that. ("The Old Script" was its working title, taken from the final lines of [this Peter Boyle poem](https://www.poetryinternational.com/en/poets-poems/poems/poem/103-9755_THE-UNKNOWABLE)).

Skip to the end for the latest; it's a working doc.

## First bits of telling people about the self-publish plan \[23.10.25\]

I [have a post](https://coveredinbees.org/posts/i_wrote_a_scifi_book/) about the plan. Err. Who to tell? Let's start somewhere / keep a record.

-   Facebook - starting with Sheffield sci-fi and fantasy group (not meeting at the mo but FB still going). Draft:

    -   Hi folks, hope you don't mind me posting here - I'm a Sheffield first-time sci-fi author just embarking on a self-publishing mission. I've written a post about the plan on my blog ("I wrote a sci-fi book about AI before chatGPT came out. Now what?") If you fancy followng along with the ups and downs (I'm aiming for 6 -9 months, let's see if that becomes years!) go to the blog and stick your email in the subscribe box (via the about page or top right). Any thoughts and prayers welcome!

-   On the reddit self-publish weekly self-promotion thread. I can stick later posts on there too (I think). It's up, but probably need to put that there when week renews. [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/selfpublish/comments/1oba2qo/comment/nkzvpec/).

## Getting help! \[24.10.25\]

Writing community and help has been fckin vital in getting this thing done up to now. I need to cultivate more and pester people for advice along the way. So some ideas on what I'm doing next to keep that going / grow it.

-   Gary Gibson, found via Jericho, but he'll get the full cut if going by his own site presumably. Worth just having an hour's chat to get things going. <https://www.garygibson.net/#editing>

-   Chatting to Sheffield writers workshop peeps again (help get the slack lively again).

If I try to chat to Gary though, I could do with being clear on what I want. Do I know that? It keeps on changing a little. From "Just get closure so I can stop thinking out it" to "Actually, I believe in the book and want to maximise my chances of people reading it, and I'm willing to take the time to try and get it right, including horrible amounts of self promotion."
