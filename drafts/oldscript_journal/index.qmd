# What's this?

A journal of progress (or lack of it) on getting the sci-fi book self-published and "one last edit"ed prior to that. ("The Old Script" was its working title, taken from the final lines of [this Peter Boyle poem](https://www.poetryinternational.com/en/poets-poems/poems/poem/103-9755_THE-UNKNOWABLE)).

Skip to the end for the latest; it's a working doc.

## First bits of telling people about the self-publish plan \[23.10.25\]

I [have a post](https://coveredinbees.org/posts/i_wrote_a_scifi_book/) about the plan. Err. Who to tell? Let's start somewhere / keep a record.

-   Facebook - starting with Sheffield sci-fi and fantasy group (not meeting at the mo but FB still going). Draft:

    -   Hi folks, hope you don't mind me posting here - I'm a Sheffield first-time sci-fi author just embarking on a self-publishing mission. I've written a post about the plan on my blog ("I wrote a sci-fi book about AI before chatGPT came out. Now what?") If you fancy followng along with the ups and downs (I'm aiming for 6 -9 months, let's see if that becomes years!) go to the blog and stick your email in the subscribe box (via the about page or top right). Any thoughts and prayers welcome!

-   On the reddit self-publish weekly self-promotion thread. I can stick later posts on there too (I think). It's up, but probably need to put that there when week renews. [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/selfpublish/comments/1oba2qo/comment/nkzvpec/).
