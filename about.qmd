**Reader, I have missed you. Where have you been?** 

What’s that? Speak up! Buried under an inconceivably vast and metastasizing word-mountain, you say? Only a shrinking fraction of which is now human-produced, you say? The noise an unbearable tinnitus that makes you want to set your own head in concrete, you say?

What you need, I think, is another blog. 

### And look down there! A subscribe button! Aaah go on. (Or the RSS feed link is top right.)

## Contractual "what to expect" section

My [other writing](https://www.danolner.net/#writing-anchor) is a pretty good guide. So that'll be things like:

* Political economy, spatial stuff, economic history and climate change, as well as ideas connected to my [spatial econ data-sciencing](https://danolner.github.io/) and [other work](https://www.danolner.net/). 
* A common theme is asking, "Are we more than just mindless ants? What abilities and systems can humans build to determine our own destiny?" (Two examples of posts on that subject: how humans are [natural distributed systems makers](https://coveredinbees.org.archived.website/3adaptivelandscapes.html), what Balinese rice pest management, Peruvian potato growing and the market economy have in common, why it’s all tangled up with magic and why it means Hayek was wrong; [picking apart](https://www.danolner.net/2022/08/jordan-petersons-zombie-climate-ideas) Jordan Peterson's tediously shallow neoliberalism that underpins his climate nonsense, as a reminder that we are not, in fact, just mindless ants).
* Also, I wrote a sci-fi book about AI, which I finished in the summer of 2022 after four years of research/writing... a couple of months before the 1st chatGPT public release. I'm examining LLM economic impacts in my dayjob, but I also want to return to the themes in the book, and mull the book's LLM 'before / after'. Does it still work, what doesn't? After failed attempts at trad publishing, I will doing the [self-publish](https://www.reddit.com/r/selfpublish/) thing, and writing about that process here too.

## Musings

I called my first ever blog 'coveredinbees' back in 2006 before embarking on a PhD. The name was an [Izzard-flavoured](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYuvLSFFalo) hat-tip to the [emergence / self-organisation ideas](https://coveredinbees.org.archived.website/node/391.html) I planned to study. (Someone later pointed out I could also have linked to the [Fable of the Bees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fable_of_the_Bees), didn't think of that at the time.)

Early posts (a few surviving on the wayback machine) like [this](queenyandthetanners2006.html) were largely unstructured rambles of faintly connected thoughts. Various incarnations survived over the years; [this archive](https://coveredinbees.org.archived.website/) was the last one and [this page](https://www.danolner.net/#writing-anchor) lists my favourite bits.

Twenty years later, of course, through diligent practice and academic training, my writing is now like a scalpel. 

Hahahaha. I jest. No. I did manage to [write a PhD](https://github.com/DanOlner/PhD-thesis-n-code) (in twice the time I was supposed to) and a sci-fi book (more on that soon). But from those early puppyish, over-enthusiastic ramblings of youth, I have passed through trying to be something I'm not, back in my autumn years[^1] to "Aaaaa just get on with the rambling. Who cares? We'll all be dead soon."

Slightly less flippantly... coveredinbees (and early C21st blogging generally, a world that still survives at the margins) allowed a kind of free exploration and experimentation that I miss. That dovetails with the direction work is taking, as I'm playing with [opening up economic tools and ideas](https://danolner.github.io/RegionalEconomicTools/) through github. That site leans heavily towards the narrow how-to stuff - I want to open that up, connect to "so what" and arguments around things like how we measure, how we connect ideas through to tools.

And why make things simple when they can be complicated? Setting this up to work through [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) and [github](https://github.com/DanOlner/coveredinbees) is considerably more faff than, say, signing up for substack. But as I [go on about here](posts/why_sfd), there are practical and personal reasons for choosing this instead.

So let's see how it goes...

*p.s. that pic is a killer onion I made for the [Sharrow Lantern Carnival](https://www.sharrowlanterncarnival.org/) in 2006. It towered over me, carried on a rucksack, with wavey arms. The teeth flashed and everything.*
