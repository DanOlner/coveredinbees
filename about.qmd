**Reader, I have missed you. Where have you been?** 

Whatâ€™s that? Speak up! Buried under an inconceivably vast and metastasizing word-mountain, you say? Only a shrinking fraction of which is now human-produced, you say? The noise an unbearable tinnitus that makes you want to set your own head in concrete, you say?

What you need, I think, is another blog. And look over there! A subscribe button! Go on. If you're really keen, too keen, click the 'send me 1st drafts' button as well ([see here](../posts/why_sfd) for why this option's available).

RSS feeds top right, some links to other places above and below.

*p.s. that pic is a killer onion I made for the [Sharrow Lantern Carnival](https://www.sharrowlanterncarnival.org/) in 2006. The teeth flashed and everything.*
