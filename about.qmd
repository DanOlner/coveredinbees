**Where have you been?** 

Whatâ€™s that? Speak up! Buried under an inconceivably vast and metastasizing word-mountain, you say? Only a shrinking fraction of which is now human-produced, you say? The noise an unbearable tinnitus that makes you want to set your own head in concrete, you say?

What you need, I think, is another blog. 

### And look down there! A subscribe button! Aah go on. 

If you're really keen, too keen, click the 'send me 1st drafts' button as well ([see here](../posts/why_sfd) for why this option's available).

Direct RSS feeds are top right.

## Contractual "what to expect" section

My [older writing](https://www.danolner.net/#writing-anchor) is a pretty good guide - political economy, spatial stuff, economic history, climate change, "are we more than just mindless ants" arguments over and over.

From now on, expect more ramblings about how economic ideas connect (or don't) through to 'dig where you stand' regional economic outcomes, as I try to [build tools](https://danolner.github.io/RegionalEconomicTools/) to support that.

## Musings

I called my first ever blog 'coveredinbees' back in 2006 before embarking on a PhD. The name was an [Izzard-flavoured](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYuvLSFFalo) hat-tip to the [emergence / self-organisation ideas](https://coveredinbees.org.archived.website/node/391.html) I planned to study. (Someone later pointed out I could also have linked to the [Fable of the Bees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fable_of_the_Bees), didn't think of that at the time.) Early posts (a few surviving on the wayback machine) like [this](queenyandthetanners2006.html) were largely unstructured rambles of faintly connected thoughts. Various incarnations survived over the years; [this archive](https://coveredinbees.org.archived.website/) was the last one and [this page](https://www.danolner.net/#writing-anchor) lists my favourite bits.

Twenty years later, of course, through diligent practice and academic training, my writing is now like a scalpel. Hahahaha. I jest. No. I did manage to [write a PhD](https://github.com/DanOlner/PhD-thesis-n-code) (in twice the time I was supposed to) and a sci-fi book (more on that soon). But from those early puppyish, over-enthusiastic ramblings of youth, I have passed into the autumn years of once again thinking, "Aaaaa just get on with the rambling. Who cares? We'll all be dead soon."

Slightly less flippantly... coveredinbees (and early C21st century blogging generally, a world that still survives at the margins) allowed a kind of free exploration and experimentation that I miss. That dovetails with the direction work is going in, as I'm playing with [opening up economic tools and ideas](https://danolner.github.io/RegionalEconomicTools/) through github. That site leans heavily towards the narrow how-to stuff - I want to open that up, connect to "so what" and arguments around things like how we measure, how we connect ideas through to tools.

And why make things simple when they can be complicated? Setting this up to work through Quarto and github is considerably more faff than, say, signing up for substack. But as I [go on about here](../posts/why_sfd), there are practical and personal reasons for choosing this kind of path.

So let's see how this goes...
